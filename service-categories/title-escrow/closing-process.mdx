---

Closing is the final step in a real estate transaction where documents are signed, funds are transferred, and ownership changes hands. The process begins when a purchase contract is executed and ends when documents are recorded with the county.

Most closings occur 30-45 days after contract execution for financed purchases. Cash transactions may close faster.

## Documents Signed at Closing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Buyers Sign">
    **Loan documents (if financing):**
    - Promissory note (promise to repay the loan)
    - Mortgage or deed of trust (security instrument)
    - Closing Disclosure (final loan terms and costs)

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
The settlement statement (also called HUD-1 or closing statement) itemizes all transaction costs. Review this document carefully before signing. It shows purchase price, loan amounts, credits, prorations, and who pays what.
</Note>

## After Signing

Signing documents does not immediately transfer ownership. Several steps follow.

**Fund disbursement**
Once all documents are signed and funds verified, the escrow officer disburses money according to the settlement statement:
- Seller's existing mortgage paid off
- Seller receives net proceeds
- Real estate commissions paid
- Title fees and closing costs distributed
- Recording fees sent to county

**Recording**
The deed and mortgage are filed with the county recording office. This creates public record of the ownership transfer. Recording typically occurs same day or next business day.

**Key release**
Keys are released after recording confirmation. In some areas, keys are released at signing with the understanding that recording will follow. Local practices vary.

**Final documents**
Title company delivers final closing package within 30 days, including:
- Recorded deed (once returned from county)
- Final settlement statement
- Title insurance policy (may take 30-60 days)
- Copies of all signed documents

## Remote and Split Closings

Not all closings happen in person at the same time.

**Remote closings**
Some transactions allow electronic signatures and remote notarization. Availability depends on state law, lender requirements, and title company capabilities.

**Split closings**
Buyers and sellers sign separately, sometimes on different days or in different locations. Common when parties cannot coordinate schedules or are in different geographic areas.

**Mail-away closings**
Documents are sent to parties who sign and return them by mail or overnight delivery. Used when in-person signing is not possible.

## Common Closing Day Issues

**Wire delays**
Funds not received in time can delay closing. Initiate wires 1-2 days early and confirm receipt with the title company.

**Document errors**
Name misspellings, incorrect addresses, or calculation errors require corrections before signing. Review documents in advance when possible.

**Missing items**
Outstanding documentation requests, insurance certificates, or ID issues can delay closing. Confirm all requirements are met before the appointment.

**Last-minute changes**
Changes to loan terms or settlement figures after Closing Disclosure was issued may reset the 3-day waiting period (for financed purchases).

<Tip>
Request settlement statement and closing documents 24-48 hours before closing when possible. Reviewing in advance allows time to identify and resolve issues before the appointment.
</Tip>

## Questions to Ask

**"Can I review documents before closing day?"**
Advance review prevents surprises and allows questions to be addressed before the appointment.

**"What do I need to bring?"**
Confirm ID requirements, payment methods, and any outstanding documentation.

**"How will I receive wire instructions?"**
Verify secure delivery methods. Never rely on emailed wire instructions without phone verification.

**"When will keys be released?"**
Understand whether keys are released at signing or after recording confirmation.

**"What documents will I receive after closing?"**
Know what to expect and when, including the recorded deed and title insurance policy.
