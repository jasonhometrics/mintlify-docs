## How to Find and Analyze Investment Properties

Successful real estate investing requires finding properties that meet investment criteria and thoroughly evaluating them before purchase. The analysis process differs from buying a primary residence, focusing on income potential, expenses, and return metrics rather than personal preferences.

Most deals investors analyze do not meet their criteria. Evaluating many properties to find the right ones is normal.

## Where to Find Properties

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multiple Listing Service (MLS)">
    Properties listed by real estate agents appear on MLS, which feeds to major real estate websites. Most available inventory is found here.

    **Advantages:**

    - Largest selection of properties
    - Standardized listing information
    - Professional representation available

    **Considerations:**

    - Competition from other buyers
    - Properties priced at market value
    - Best deals often sell quickly
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Off-market properties">
    Properties not publicly listed for sale. Sellers may be motivated but have not engaged an agent.

    **Sources:**

    - Direct mail to property owners
    - Driving for dollars (identifying distressed properties)
    - Networking with wholesalers
    - Probate and estate attorneys
    - Property management companies

    **Advantages:**

    - Less competition
    - Potential for below-market pricing
    - Motivated sellers

    **Considerations:**

    - Requires more effort to find
    - No agent guidance on seller side
    - May need more negotiation
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Auctions and foreclosures">
    Properties sold through auction, bank-owned (REO) sales, or foreclosure proceedings.

    **Types:**

    - Courthouse auctions (tax sales, foreclosure sales)
    - Online auction platforms
    - Bank REO listings
    - HUD homes

    **Advantages:**

    - Potential below-market pricing
    - Motivated institutional sellers

    **Considerations:**

    - May require cash or quick financing
    - Limited or no inspection opportunity
    - Title issues possible
    - Competition from experienced investors
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wholesalers">
    Investors who find off-market deals and assign contracts to other buyers for a fee.

    **Advantages:**

    - Deals are pre-negotiated
    - Often below market value
    - Saves time finding deals

    **Considerations:**

    - Assignment fee adds to cost
    - Quality varies widely
    - Verify numbers independently
    - Build relationships with reliable wholesalers
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Market Analysis

Before evaluating individual properties, understand the market where you plan to invest.

**Key market factors:**

| Factor               | What to Research                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Population trends    | Growing, stable, or declining?                         |
| Employment           | Major employers, job growth, diversity of industries   |
| Rental demand        | Vacancy rates, absorption trends, renter demographics  |
| Rent levels          | Current rents, historical trends, rent-to-price ratios |
| Appreciation history | Price trends over 5-10 years                           |
| Landlord-tenant laws | Eviction timelines, rent control, tenant protections   |

<Note>
  Markets with strong job growth and population increases typically offer better long-term appreciation and rental demand.
</Note>

## Property Analysis

Evaluate each potential property using consistent criteria and metrics.

### Income Analysis

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Determine market rent">
    Research comparable rentals to estimate achievable rent:

    - Similar size, bedrooms, bathrooms
    - Same neighborhood or comparable area
    - Similar condition and amenities
    - Currently listed and recently rented properties

    Sources: Zillow, Rentometer, Craigslist, property managers, MLS rental listings
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verify existing rents">
    If the property has tenants, current rents may be above or below market:

    - Request copies of current leases
    - Compare to market rent analysis
    - Understand when leases expire
    - Factor in rent increase potential or risk of turnover
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Other income">
    Identify additional income sources:

    - Laundry facilities
    - Parking fees
    - Storage rentals
    - Pet fees
    - Application fees
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Expense Analysis

Accurate expense estimation prevents overpaying and ensures positive cash flow.

| Expense Category     | Typical Range      | Notes                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Property taxes       | Varies by location | Verify with county assessor; may change after sale   |
| Insurance            | \$800-2,000+/year  | Get quotes for landlord policy                       |
| Property management  | 8-12% of rent      | Even if self-managing, include for accurate analysis |
| Maintenance          | 5-10% of rent      | Higher for older properties                          |
| Vacancy              | 5-8% of rent       | Market dependent                                     |
| Capital expenditures | 5-10% of rent      | Reserves for roof, HVAC, etc.                        |
| Utilities            | Varies             | If owner-paid; verify what is included               |
| HOA fees             | Varies             | If applicable                                        |
| Lawn/snow            | \$50-200/month     | If owner responsibility                              |

<Warning>
  Seller-provided expense numbers are often incomplete or understated. Build your own expense estimates using market data and actual quotes.
</Warning>

### Running the Numbers

Calculate key metrics for every property under consideration.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Net Operating Income (NOI)">
    Gross rental income minus operating expenses (excluding mortgage).

    **Calculation:**

    - Gross rent: \$2,000/month × 12 = \$24,000
    - Vacancy (5%): -\$1,200
    - Effective gross income: \$22,800
    - Operating expenses: -\$8,400
    - **NOI: \$14,400**
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cap Rate">
    NOI divided by purchase price. Allows comparison across properties.

    **Calculation:**

    - NOI: \$14,400
    - Purchase price: \$180,000
    - **Cap rate: 8%** (\$14,400 ÷ \$180,000)

    Higher cap rates indicate higher returns but often come with more risk or lower quality properties.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cash Flow">
    NOI minus annual debt service (mortgage payments).

    **Calculation:**

    - NOI: \$14,400
    - Annual mortgage payments: -\$10,800
    - \*\*Cash flow: \$3,600/year\*\* (\$300/month)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cash-on-Cash Return">
    Annual cash flow divided by total cash invested.

    **Calculation:**

    - Annual cash flow: \$3,600
    - Cash invested: \$45,000 (down payment + closing costs)
    - **Cash-on-cash return: 8%** (\$3,600 ÷ \$45,000)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Due Diligence

Once a property meets initial criteria, thorough due diligence confirms assumptions and identifies issues.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Property inspection">
    Hire a professional inspector to evaluate structure, systems, and condition. Investment property inspections should be thorough since repair costs directly impact returns.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rent verification">
    For occupied properties, verify current leases, payment history, and security deposits. Request estoppel certificates from tenants confirming lease terms.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Expense verification">
    Request actual expense records: utility bills, tax statements, insurance policies, repair invoices, property management statements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Title search">
    Review title report for liens, encumbrances, easements, or ownership issues that could affect the investment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insurance quotes">
    Get landlord insurance quotes to verify insurance expense assumptions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Property tax verification">
    Confirm current taxes and research whether reassessment after sale will increase taxes significantly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Zoning and permits">
    Verify the property is legally zoned for intended use. Check for unpermitted work that could create issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Environmental concerns">
    For older properties, consider lead paint, asbestos, or other environmental issues. Some properties warrant Phase I environmental assessments.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Red Flags

Issues that warrant caution or walking away from a deal.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Numbers that do not work">
    If the property does not meet your return criteria at asking price, either negotiate or move on. Do not convince yourself a bad deal is good.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deferred maintenance">
    Significant deferred maintenance indicates future capital expenditure needs. Factor repair costs into the purchase price or walk away.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Foundation or structural issues">
    Major structural problems are expensive and difficult to fully assess. Proceed with extreme caution or avoid entirely.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Environmental contamination">
    Properties with known contamination or high contamination risk (former gas stations, dry cleaners) can have unlimited liability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Title problems">
    Unresolved liens, ownership disputes, or unclear title history create risk. Ensure issues are resolved before closing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Problem tenants">
    Inherited tenants with payment issues, lease violations, or difficult behavior create immediate challenges. Understand tenant situations before buying.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Declining area">
    Properties in areas with population loss, rising vacancy, or economic decline may underperform regardless of the individual property's merits.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Working with Agents

Real estate agents can help investors find and evaluate properties, but not all agents understand investor needs.

**What to look for:**

- Experience with investment properties
- Understanding of investor analysis methods
- Access to rental data and comparables
- Willingness to submit multiple offers
- Network of investor-friendly service providers

**Questions to ask:**

- How many investment properties have you helped clients purchase?
- Can you provide rental comparables for properties we evaluate?
- Are you familiar with analyzing properties for cash flow?
- Do you work with other investors who might share off-market deals?

<Tip>
  Analyze deals consistently using a spreadsheet or calculator. Emotional decisions lead to overpaying. If the numbers do not work, the property is not a good investment regardless of how much you like it.
