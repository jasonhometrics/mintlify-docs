title: "Under Contract to Closing"
description: "What happens after accepting an offer"
---

After accepting an offer, the transaction enters the contract period. During this phase, the buyer conducts inspections, the lender orders an appraisal, and the title company prepares for closing. Sellers remain relatively passive but must respond to requests and resolve any issues that arise.

Most closings occur 30-45 days after contract execution.

## Buyer's Due Diligence Period

The first 7-14 days after contract execution are typically the buyer's inspection period. During this time, the buyer evaluates the property condition.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Home inspection">
    Buyer hires a home inspector to evaluate the property's condition. Inspection typically takes 2-3 hours. Sellers should vacate during the inspection and ensure all areas are accessible.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Specialty inspections">
    Depending on property characteristics, buyers may order additional inspections: radon testing, mold assessment, termite/pest inspection, sewer line scope, well and septic testing, or other specialized evaluations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Appraisal">
    The buyer's lender orders an appraisal to confirm the property value supports the loan amount. The appraiser visits the property, takes photos, and compares to recent sales. Sellers should ensure the home is clean and accessible.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Responding to Repair Requests

After inspections, buyers typically submit a list of requested repairs or credits. Sellers have options for responding.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agree to repairs">
    Complete the requested repairs before closing. Seller controls timing and contractors but must meet buyer's expectations for quality.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Offer credit instead">
    Provide a closing cost credit or price reduction instead of making repairs. Buyer handles repairs after closing. Often preferred by sellers who don't want to manage contractors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agree to some items">
    Negotiate specific items. Common approach focuses on safety issues and major systems while declining cosmetic or minor maintenance requests.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Decline all requests">
    Refuse to make repairs or offer credit. Buyer must decide whether to proceed as-is or terminate the contract.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Focus negotiations on safety hazards, major defects, and items affecting habitability or financing. Cosmetic issues and routine maintenance are typically not negotiated.

## When the Appraisal Comes in Low

If the appraisal comes in below the purchase price, the transaction must be renegotiated. The lender will only base the loan on the appraised value.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Reduce the price">
    Lower the purchase price to match the appraised value. Seller receives less but keeps the deal together.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Buyer covers the gap">
    Buyer brings additional cash to cover the difference between appraised value and purchase price. Requires buyer to have funds available.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Split the difference">
    Seller reduces price and buyer brings additional funds to meet in the middle.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Challenge the appraisal">
    Provide additional comparable sales or property information that may support a higher value. Success is not guaranteed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Buyer terminates">
    If the appraisal contingency is in place and parties cannot agree, the buyer may terminate and receive earnest money back.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Title and Closing Process

While the buyer completes due diligence, the title company works in the background.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Title search">
    Title examiner researches ownership history, identifies liens, judgments, and claims, and prepares a preliminary title report. Any issues must be resolved before closing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document preparation">
    Title company prepares the settlement statement showing all transaction costs, credits, and prorations. Closing documents are drafted and reviewed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Payoff coordination">
    If you have an existing mortgage, the title company obtains a payoff statement from your lender. The mortgage will be paid off from sale proceeds at closing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scheduling closing">
    Title company coordinates with all parties to schedule the closing appointment. Sellers may sign separately from buyers or at the same time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    - Settlement statement (itemizes all costs and proceeds)
    - Affidavit of title (confirms ownership and known issues)
    - Loan payoff authorization (if existing mortgage)
    - Transfer tax declarations
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What to bring">

    - Any outstanding documentation requested
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Receiving proceeds">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
