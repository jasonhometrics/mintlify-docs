Performance badges identify businesses that demonstrate consistent service quality through verified customer reviews. Badges appear on business profiles and in search results.

Hometrics assigns badges automatically based on review activity, ratings, and customer feedback patterns. Businesses cannot purchase badges or request manual assignment.

## How Badges Work

### Automatic Assignment

Badges are assigned automatically through periodic evaluation of business performance metrics. Businesses receive email notification when badges are earned or removed.

Evaluation includes:

- Customer review ratings and rating distribution
- Review volume consistency over time
- Business longevity and sustained performance
- Response times to customer inquiries
- Review authenticity verification

### Maintaining Badges

Businesses must maintain qualifying performance standards to keep badges. Badges are removed if performance declines, review patterns change significantly, or if review activity becomes inconsistent.

Multiple badges can be held simultaneously. Fast Responder badges complement performance badges (Trending, Top Rated, Local Legend) since they measure different quality indicators.

### What We Don't Disclose

Specific calculation formulas, exact review count thresholds, and detailed timing requirements are not published. This prevents manipulation of review metrics and maintains badge integrity.

## Badge Integrity

<Warning>
  Hometrics monitors review patterns to detect manipulation attempts. Businesses engaging in review fraud, incentivized reviews, or coordinated review campaigns will have badges removed and may face profile suspension.
</Warning>

Review authenticity verification includes:

- Review timing and distribution analysis
- Customer verification status checks
- Cross-reference with Google review patterns
- Detection of unusual review activity

Badges reflect verified performance based on authentic customer reviews and platform engagement. Reputation management services do not influence badge assignment or guarantee badge eligibility.
