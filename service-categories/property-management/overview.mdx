A property manager is a professional or company hired to oversee the daily operations of rental real estate on behalf of the owner. Property management services range from tenant placement only to full-service management including maintenance, rent collection, and financial reporting.

Property managers act as intermediaries between property owners and tenants, handling operational tasks that owners cannot or prefer not to manage themselves.

## Why Property Management Matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Time and distance">
    Managing rental property requires significant time:

    - Responding to tenant inquiries
    - Coordinating maintenance and repairs
    - Handling emergencies
    - Collecting rent and managing finances
    - Marketing vacancies and showing units

    Owners who live far from their properties or have limited time often benefit from professional management.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Legal compliance">
    Landlord-tenant law is complex and varies by jurisdiction:

    - Fair housing requirements
    - Security deposit regulations
    - Eviction procedures
    - Habitability standards
    - Lease requirements
    - Local ordinances

    Property managers stay current on legal requirements and help owners avoid costly mistakes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tenant quality">
    Professional managers typically have established processes for:

    - Marketing to qualified applicants
    - Screening tenants (credit, background, income, references)
    - Verifying application information
    - Selecting tenants consistently and legally

    Better tenant selection reduces turnover, late payments, and property damage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Maintenance efficiency">
    Established property managers often have:

    - Relationships with reliable contractors
    - Volume discounts on services
    - 24/7 emergency response systems
    - Preventive maintenance programs

    This can result in faster repairs, lower costs, and better-maintained properties.
