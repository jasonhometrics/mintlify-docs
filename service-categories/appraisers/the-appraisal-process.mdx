description: "How appraisals work and what appraisers evaluate"
---

The appraisal process involves property inspection, market research, and analysis to develop an opinion of value. Understanding each step helps property owners prepare and know what to expect.

A typical residential appraisal takes one to two weeks from order to delivery.

## Process Overview

<Steps>
  <Step title="Appraisal ordered">
    Lender or property owner orders appraisal. For mortgage transactions, order goes through AMC or lender's approved panel. Private appraisals can be ordered directly from appraiser.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Appraiser assigned">
    Qualified appraiser in the property's area accepts assignment. Appraiser reviews order details and schedules inspection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inspection scheduled">
    Appraiser contacts property owner or agent to schedule. Inspection typically requires 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on property size and complexity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Property inspection">
    Appraiser visits property to assess condition, measure, photograph, and note features. May ask questions about updates and improvements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Market research">
    Appraiser researches comparable sales, market conditions, and neighborhood factors. Identifies 3-6 comparable properties.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analysis and adjustments">
    Appraiser compares subject property to comparables, making adjustments for differences. Develops value conclusion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Report preparation">
    Findings documented in standardized report format. Includes photos, maps, comparable data, and value conclusion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Quality review">
    For mortgage appraisals, AMC or lender reviews report for completeness and credibility before accepting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Report delivery">
    Final report delivered to lender and borrower. Borrower entitled to copy at least 3 days before closing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Property Inspection

<AccordionGroup>

    Appraiser evaluates from outside:

    - Overall condition and curb appeal
    - Roof condition and material
    - Siding and exterior finishes
    - Foundation visible condition
    - Windows and doors
    - Garage and outbuildings

    - Kitchen condition and features
    - Bathroom count and condition
    - Flooring types and condition
    - Wall and ceiling condition
    - Built-in features
    - Basement and attic condition
    - Mechanical systems (HVAC, water heater)
    - Overall quality and condition
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Measurements">
    Appraiser measures or verifies square footage:

    - Gross living area (above-grade finished space)
    - Basement square footage (below-grade, counted separately)
    - Garage square footage
    - Porch and deck areas

    Measurements should match tax records or prior appraisals. Discrepancies are noted and explained.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Photographs">
    Standard photos include:

    - Front of property
    - Rear of property
    - Street scene
    - Kitchen
    - Main bathroom
    - Each bedroom
    - Living areas
    - Basement (if applicable)
    - Any issues or notable features

    Photos document condition at time of inspection.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What appraisers don't do">
    Appraisals are not inspections. Appraisers do not:

    - Test systems (electrical, plumbing, HVAC)
    - Move furniture or stored items
    - Enter crawl spaces or walk roofs
    - Identify hidden defects
    - Guarantee condition
    - Check for code compliance

    Home inspection is separate service for condition assessment.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Appraisers note visible condition but don't test systems or identify hidden problems. A property can appraise at full value while having issues only an inspection would reveal.
</Note>

## What Appraisers Evaluate

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Location">
    Location significantly impacts value:

    - Neighborhood quality and desirability
    - School districts
    - Proximity to amenities
    - Traffic and noise levels
    - Views
    - Adjacent property uses
    - Market trends in area

    Location factors can add or subtract significant value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Site characteristics">
    Lot features affect value:

    - Lot size
    - Shape and usability
    - Topography
    - Landscaping
    - Drainage
    - Utilities available
    - Easements and encroachments
    - Zoning compliance
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Improvements">
    Building characteristics:

    - Size (gross living area)
    - Age and effective age
    - Quality of construction
    - Design and layout functionality
    - Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
    - Garage size and type
    - Basement (finished vs unfinished)
    - Additional structures
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Condition">
    Physical state of property:

    - **C1:** New construction
    - **C2:** Recently built or renovated like new
    - **C3:** Well maintained, minimal deferred maintenance
    - **C4:** Adequately maintained, minor deferred maintenance
    - **C5:** Fair condition, needs repairs
    - **C6:** Poor condition, significant repairs needed

    Condition rating directly affects value conclusion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quality">
    Construction quality rating:

    - **Q1:** Unique, highest quality custom construction
    - **Q2:** Custom design and high quality materials
    - **Q3:** Above average quality
    - **Q4:** Standard quality
    - **Q5:** Basic quality
    - **Q6:** Below standard quality

    Higher quality supports higher value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Updates and renovations">
    Improvements add value:

    - Kitchen remodels
    - Bathroom updates
    - New roof
    - Updated HVAC
    - New windows
    - Flooring replacement
    - Additions

    Appraiser notes age and quality of updates. Recent updates in good condition add more value than older renovations.

    Layout and design practicality:

    - Room flow and access
    - Bedroom and bathroom ratio
    - Kitchen functionality
    - Storage adequacy
    - Bedroom size
    - Ceiling heights

    Poor layout or unusual features can reduce value.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Valuation Approaches

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sales comparison approach">
    Primary method for residential appraisals. Compares subject to recent sales of similar properties.

    **Process:**

    1. Identify comparable sales (similar size, age, location, features)
    2. Adjust for differences between comparables and subject
    3. Reconcile adjusted values to develop opinion

    **Example adjustments:**

    - Subject has 3 bedrooms, comp has 4: Adjust comp down
    - Subject has updated kitchen, comp has original: Adjust comp up
    - Subject is 2,000 sq ft, comp is 1,800 sq ft: Adjust comp up

    Most weight given to most similar comparables.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cost approach">
    Estimates value based on cost to build new minus depreciation, plus land value.

    **Formula:** Land value + (Cost to build new - Depreciation) = Value

    **Used when:**

    - New construction
    - Unique properties with few comparables
    - Special-use properties
    - Insurance valuations

    Less reliable for older homes where depreciation is difficult to estimate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Income approach">
    Values property based on income it could generate.

    **Used for:**

    - Rental properties
    - Multi-family buildings
    - Commercial properties

    **Calculation:** Net operating income / Capitalization rate = Value

    Rarely used as primary approach for single-family homes but may support value for investment properties.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reconciliation">
    Appraiser weighs all applicable approaches to reach final value.

    For typical residential property, sales comparison approach receives most weight. Other approaches may support or verify the conclusion.

    Final value is appraiser's opinion based on all available data.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Selecting Comparables

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Ideal comparable characteristics">
    Best comparables are:

    - Same neighborhood or competing area
    - Similar size (within 20% of gross living area)
    - Similar age (within 10-15 years)
    - Same style (ranch to ranch, colonial to colonial)
    - Same bedroom and bathroom count
    - Sold within 6 months
    - Arms-length transaction (not foreclosure, family sale)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Number of comparables">
    Standard appraisals include 3-6 comparable sales.

    **Minimum:** 3 comparables required for most mortgage appraisals

    **More used when:**

    - Market is uncertain
    - Available comparables require significant adjustment
    - Property has unusual features
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Distance considerations">
    Comparables should be nearby:

    - Same subdivision preferred
    - Same neighborhood acceptable
    - Competing neighborhoods if necessary
    - Different market areas require explanation

    Urban areas have tighter distance requirements than rural areas with fewer sales.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Adjustment limitations">
    Large adjustments reduce comparable reliability:

    - Individual adjustment over 10% raises questions
    - Total adjustments over 25% suggest weak comparable
    - Net adjustments over 15% need explanation

    Appraisers prefer comparables requiring minimal adjustment.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Appraisers cannot use listings (properties for sale but not sold) as comparables. Only closed sales demonstrate what buyers actually paid. Pending sales may be considered as supporting data.
</Warning>

## Preparing for an Appraisal

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Property preparation">
    Basic preparation helps inspection go smoothly:

    - Ensure access to all areas (attic, basement, garage)
    - Clear clutter blocking views of rooms
    - Make sure utilities are on
    - Secure pets
    - Remove vehicles from driveway

    Deep cleaning isn't necessary but property should be accessible.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Documentation to have ready">
    Helpful information for appraiser:

    - List of improvements with dates and costs
    - Permits for major work
    - Survey if available
    - HOA documents with fees
    - Recent utility bills (for income properties)
    - Previous appraisal (if available)

    Appraiser isn't required to use this information but it provides helpful context.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Comparable sales to mention">
    You can provide information about sales you're aware of:

    - Recent neighborhood sales
    - Similar properties that sold well
    - Sales that support your value expectations

    Appraiser will verify and consider but makes independent decision on which comparables to use.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What not to do">
    Avoid actions that could be problematic:

    - Don't pressure appraiser for specific value
    - Don't argue during inspection
    - Don't misrepresent improvements or features
    - Don't prevent access to any area
    - Don't accompany appraiser room-to-room (let them work)

    Be available for questions but let appraiser conduct inspection independently.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## After the Inspection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Waiting for report">

    - Renegotiate purchase price
    - Increase down payment
    - Challenge with additional comparables
    - Order second appraisal (if lender allows)
    - Walk away (if contingency allows)
