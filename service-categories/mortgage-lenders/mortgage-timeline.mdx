description: "Understanding the process from application through closing"
---

The mortgage process spans from initial application through closing, typically taking 30-45 days once a property is under contract. Understanding each phase clarifies what happens when and what documentation is needed.

Timelines vary based on loan program, property type, and lender capacity. VA and USDA loans may take longer. Complex income situations require additional verification time.

## Phase by Phase

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pre-Approval (Before Shopping)">
    Pre-approval happens before looking at properties. It establishes purchasing power and signals to sellers that financing is likely to close.

    **What happens:**

    - Initial consultation with loan officer
    - Documentation submitted and reviewed
    - Credit report pulled
    - Income and assets verified
    - Debt-to-income calculated
    - Pre-approval letter issued

    **Timeline:** 1-3 business days with complete documentation

    **Documentation needed:**

    - Income verification (W-2s, tax returns, pay stubs)
    - Asset statements (bank accounts, investments)
    - Identification

    **Important:** Pre-approval is based on a financial snapshot. If circumstances change during the home search (job change, new debt, large purchase), notify the loan officer immediately. Major changes may require updated documentation or affect loan eligibility.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Application (After Contract is Signed)">
    The formal loan application is submitted after a purchase contract is executed. This is when the lender begins work on the specific property.

    - Decision issued: approved, approved with conditions, suspended, or denied

    - Updated pay stub
    - Letter of explanation for various items

    - Any outstanding documentation requested
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When the Appraisal Comes in Low

Appraisals determine whether the property value supports the loan amount. When an appraisal comes in below the purchase price, the transaction must be renegotiated or restructured.

> **Example:** Purchase price is 400,000. Appraisal comes in at \$380,000. The lender will only base the loan on \$380,000, creating a \$20,000 gap. 

**Options when this happens:**

**Renegotiate purchase price** Request the seller reduce the price to match appraised value. Sellers may agree to avoid losing the deal.

**Pay the difference** Buyer brings additional funds to cover the gap between appraised value and purchase price. This requires available cash beyond the original down payment.

**Appraisal gap addendum** Some contracts include an appraisal gap clause where the buyer agrees upfront to cover a certain amount if the appraisal falls short. 

> For example, a \$10,000 appraisal gap addendum means the buyer will cover up to \$10,000 of any shortfall.

**Dispute the appraisal** Provide comparable sales data to the lender supporting a higher value. Lenders may order a reconsideration of value or second appraisal. Success is not guaranteed.

**Cancel the contract** If the appraisal contingency was included in the purchase contract, buyers can typically cancel and receive their earnest money back.

<Note>
  In competitive markets, buyers sometimes waive appraisal contingencies or include appraisal gap addendums to strengthen offers. This carries risk if the property appraises low and additional funds aren't available.
</Note>

## How to Stay on Track

<Tip>
  **Keep the process moving:**

  - Respond to document requests within 24 hours

**What loan officers expect:**
