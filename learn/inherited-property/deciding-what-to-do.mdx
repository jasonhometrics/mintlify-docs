## Sell, Keep, or Rent?

Inheriting property requires a decision about its future. The right choice depends on financial circumstances, property characteristics, location, and personal goals. Taking time to evaluate options objectively leads to better outcomes than rushing into a decision.

Emotional attachment to a family home can cloud judgment. Separating sentimental value from financial reality helps heirs make sound choices.

## Key Factors to Evaluate

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Property condition">
    Assess the current state of the property. Major repairs or deferred maintenance affect both sale price and rental viability. Get inspection estimates before deciding. A property needing \$50,000 in repairs presents different options than one that is move-in ready.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Location and market">
    Research the local real estate market. Strong appreciation trends favor holding. Declining areas may warrant selling. For rentals, evaluate vacancy rates, rental demand, and achievable rent levels in the neighborhood.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Financial situation of heirs">
    Consider immediate cash needs versus long-term wealth building. Heirs with debt, limited savings, or near-term expenses may benefit from selling. Those with stable finances can afford to hold for appreciation or rental income.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Distance from property">
    Managing property from another state or region adds complexity and cost. Remote owners must rely on property managers, contractors, and other local professionals. Proximity affects whether keeping the property is practical.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Number of heirs">
    Multiple heirs must agree on decisions. More owners mean more opinions and potential conflicts. Selling provides a clean split. Keeping requires ongoing coordination and agreement on expenses, management, and eventual disposition.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Existing mortgage or liens">
    Debt on the property affects options. The loan balance reduces net proceeds from a sale. Keeping the property means assuming or refinancing the debt. Calculate whether rental income would cover mortgage payments and expenses.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Your Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Option 1: Sell the property">
    Selling converts the inherited asset to cash, which can be divided among heirs, invested, or used for other purposes.

    **When selling makes sense:**

    - Multiple heirs want to liquidate and split proceeds
    - Property is distant and difficult to manage
    - Significant repairs are needed that heirs cannot or prefer not to fund
    - Local market is declining or stagnant
    - Heirs need cash for other priorities

    **Considerations:**

    - Capital gains tax on appreciation above stepped-up basis
    - Selling costs (agent commission, closing costs, repairs) reduce net proceeds
    - Market timing affects sale price
    - Probate may need to conclude or court approval obtained before selling
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Option 2: Keep as primary residence">
    One heir may choose to live in the property, either buying out other heirs or as the sole beneficiary.

    **When keeping makes sense:**

    - Property fits an heir's housing needs
    - Location is desirable for work, family, or lifestyle
    - Property is in good condition or heir is willing to renovate
    - Mortgage is favorable or property is paid off

    **Considerations:**

    - Other heirs may need to be bought out at fair market value
    - Ongoing costs include property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and utilities
    - Future sale after living there two or more years may qualify for primary residence capital gains exclusion
    - Renovations and updates may be needed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Option 3: Keep as rental property">
    Converting inherited property to a rental generates ongoing income and preserves the asset for potential future appreciation.

    **When renting makes sense:**

    - Property is in a strong rental market
    - Rental income would exceed expenses (positive cash flow)
    - Heirs want passive income rather than a lump sum
    - Property is in good condition or repairs are manageable

    **Considerations:**

    - Landlord responsibilities include tenant management, maintenance, and legal compliance
    - Property management typically costs 8-12% of monthly rent
    - Rental income is taxable, though expenses and depreciation offset income
    - Depreciation recapture applies when eventually sold
    - 1031 exchange can defer capital gains by reinvesting in another property

## Decision Framework

Use this framework to compare options systematically.

| Question                                | Favors Selling | Favors Keeping/Renting |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Do heirs need cash now?                 | Yes            | No                     |
| Is the property in good condition?      | No             | Yes                    |
| Is the location desirable?              | No             | Yes                    |
| Can heirs agree on management?          | No             | Yes                    |
| Is the rental market strong?            | N/A            | Yes                    |
| Is the property distant from all heirs? | Yes            | No                     |
| Are there multiple heirs?               | Often yes      | Requires coordination  |

## Questions to Answer Before Deciding

<Steps>
  <Step title="What is the property worth?">
    Get a professional appraisal or comparative market analysis. Know the fair market value before evaluating options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="What does it cost to maintain?">
    Calculate annual expenses: property taxes, insurance, utilities, HOA fees, and anticipated maintenance. Compare to potential rental income if considering that option.
  </Step>
  <Step title="What repairs are needed?">
    Get inspection and contractor estimates for necessary repairs. Factor these costs into the sell vs. keep analysis.
  </Step>
  <Step title="What are the tax implications of each option?">
    Consult a tax professional. Understand capital gains, rental income taxes, depreciation, and potential exclusions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Do all heirs agree?">
    Discuss options openly. Identify conflicts early. Consider buyout arrangements if heirs have different preferences.
  </Step>
  <Step title="What is the long-term plan?">
    If keeping, determine how long and under what circumstances the property would eventually be sold. Rental properties require an exit strategy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When Heirs Disagree

Multiple heirs with different goals create challenges. Several resolution approaches exist.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Buyout">
    One or more heirs purchase the others' shares at fair market value. Requires agreement on valuation and financing for the buying heir.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Delayed sale">
    Heirs agree to keep the property for a defined period (as a rental or vacant) before selling. Provides time for market conditions to improve or personal circumstances to change.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Partition action">
    A legal proceeding that forces sale of the property when heirs cannot agree. Courts can order the property sold and proceeds divided. This option is costly and adversarial.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mediation">
    A neutral third party helps heirs reach agreement. Less expensive and faster than litigation. Works best when heirs are willing to compromise.
  </Accordion>

<Tip>
  Take time to evaluate options. Unless the estate has urgent cash needs, a few weeks of research and professional consultations leads to better decisions than acting immediately.
