Inspections are not required by law but are standard practice in most residential real estate transactions.

## Why Home Inspections Matter

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Identify hidden problems">
    Properties may have defects not visible during casual viewing. Inspectors examine areas buyers typically don't access or evaluate:

    - Attic and crawl spaces
    - Roof condition
    - Electrical panels
    - Plumbing systems
    - Foundation and structure
    - HVAC equipment
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inform purchase decisions">
    Inspection findings help buyers decide whether to:

    - Proceed with purchase as planned
    - Renegotiate price based on needed repairs
    - Request seller complete repairs before closing
    - Walk away from properties with serious issues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Safety identification">
    Inspectors identify safety hazards:

    - Electrical deficiencies
    - Carbon monoxide risks
    - Fire hazards
    - Structural concerns
    - Trip and fall hazards
    - Water intrusion leading to mold
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Budget planning">
    Even when proceeding with purchase, inspection findings help buyers:

    - Anticipate near-term repair costs
    - Plan for system replacements
    - Prioritize maintenance after moving in
    - Set aside appropriate reserves
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Inspection vs Appraisal

| Factor     | Home Inspection              | Appraisal          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Purpose    | Assess condition             | Determine value    |
| Who orders | Buyer (typically)            | Lender             |
| Who pays   | Buyer                        | Buyer              |
| Required   | No (but standard)            | Yes (for mortgage) |
| Focus      | Defects and safety           | Market value       |
| Report use | Negotiation, decision-making | Loan approval      |

## When Inspections Occur

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pre-purchase inspection">
    Most common timing. Occurs after offer acceptance, during contingency period.

    **Timeline:**

    - Schedule within days of accepted offer
    - Complete before inspection contingency expires
    - Typically 7-14 days after contract execution

    Findings inform whether to proceed, renegotiate, or terminate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pre-listing inspection">
    Seller orders inspection before listing property.

    **Benefits:**

    - Identify issues before buyers find them
    - Make repairs proactively
    - Price property appropriately
    - Reduce negotiation surprises
    - Demonstrate transparency to buyers

    Not common but increasingly used in competitive markets.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="New construction inspection">
    Even new homes benefit from inspection.

    **Why inspect new construction:**

    - Builder mistakes happen
    - Code inspectors miss things
    - Warranties easier to claim early
    - Punch list verification

    Often done before final walkthrough and again at 11 months (before warranty expires).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Maintenance inspection">
    Homeowners can order inspections without buying or selling.

    **Reasons:**

    - Annual maintenance check
    - Before warranty expiration
    - After weather events
    - Before major renovation planning
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
