For private appraisals (estate, divorce, pre-listing, tax appeals), property owners select their own appraiser. Choosing the right professional affects accuracy, credibility, and usefulness of the valuation.

For mortgage appraisals, lenders assign appraisers, but understanding what makes a good appraiser helps you evaluate the work product.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mortgage appraisal situations">

## What to Look For

<AccordionGroup>

    - Condos (HOA and project analysis)
    - Multi-family (income approach)
    - Luxury homes (limited comparables)
    - Historic properties (special considerations)
    - Land (development analysis)

    Ask about experience with your specific property type.

  <Accordion title="Purpose-specific experience">
    Some appraisals have special requirements:

    - **Estate appraisals:** IRS standards, retrospective valuations
    - **Divorce appraisals:** Court requirements, potential testimony
    - **Tax appeals:** Local appeal process knowledge
    - **Litigation:** Expert witness experience

    Ask if appraiser has handled similar purpose appraisals.

</AccordionGroup>

## Red Flags

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Guaranteed value">
    No legitimate appraiser guarantees a specific value before completing the appraisal.

    If an appraiser promises to "hit a number," find someone else. This violates professional standards and produces unreliable valuations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No local experience">
    Appraisers without local market knowledge may:

    - Use inappropriate comparables
    - Miss neighborhood factors
    - Not understand local market conditions
    - Produce less credible valuations

    Ask specifically about their experience in your area.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unusually low fees">
    Very low fees may indicate:

    - Less experienced appraiser
    - Less thorough analysis
    - Form-driven approach without customization
    - High volume, low quality operation

    Quality appraisals take time and expertise. Extremely low prices often reflect lower quality.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No questions about property">
    Professional appraisers ask about:

    - Recent improvements
    - Property history
    - Known issues
    - Purpose of appraisal

    An appraiser who doesn't ask questions may not be thorough.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rush without inspection">
    Quality appraisals require adequate time. Be cautious of:

    - Same-day reports
    - Appraisals without inspection
    - Appraisers who seem too busy to be thorough

    Speed shouldn't compromise quality.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Never ask an appraiser to hit a specific value. This request violates professional standards and could result in an unreliable appraisal. Legitimate appraisers will refuse.
</Warning>
