# Wire Fraud Protection

<Warning>
Wire fraud cost real estate buyers over $350 million in 2023. Once your money is gone, it's nearly impossible to recover. This is the single highest-risk moment in your transaction.
</Warning>

## How the Scam Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Criminals Hack Email">
    They compromise email accounts of title companies, real estate agents, or even buyers. They monitor conversations and wait for the perfect moment—right before closing when large wire transfers are expected.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="They Send Fake Instructions">
    You receive an email that looks identical to your title company's format: same logo, same signature, similar email address (but slightly altered—`titlecompany@gmai1.com` instead of `titlecompany@gmail.com`).
    
    The email says: "Wiring instructions updated" or "Account changed, please wire to this account instead."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="They Create Urgency">
    "Wire today to avoid delaying closing" or "Account must be verified by end of business day." They want you to act fast without thinking.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="You Wire the Money">
    You follow the instructions because it looks legitimate. The email thread even includes past messages from your actual title company.
    
    Within minutes, your $50,000 down payment is gone.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="You Discover the Fraud">
    The real title company contacts you: "We haven't received your wire yet." You realize what happened. You call your bank—too late, funds were transferred internationally within hours.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
This isn't a "phishing scam" where you have to click a suspicious link. The email looks completely real because criminals have access to actual email conversations.
</Note>

## Protection Checklist

### Before You Wire Anything

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✓ Verify Instructions by Phone" icon="phone">
    **Never trust emailed wiring instructions, even if they look legitimate.**
    
    Call the title company using a phone number from:
    - Their website (Google it yourself)
    - Your purchase contract
    - Business card you received in person
    
    **Never** use a phone number from the email containing wiring instructions.
    
    Ask to speak to your specific contact person. Verify every digit of the account number, routing number, and amount.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="✓ Use Secure Portals, Not Email" icon="lock">
    Ask if the title company uses encrypted document portal for sharing wiring instructions. If yes, only access instructions through the portal, never email.
    
    If they insist on email, demand phone verification before wiring.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="✓ Watch for Red Flags in Email" icon="flag">
    Even if you plan to verify by phone, watch for these warning signs:
    
    - Email address slightly different from previous messages
    - Urgency or pressure to wire immediately
    - "Updated" or "changed" wiring instructions
    - Grammatical errors or unusual phrasing
    - Different contact person than you've been working with
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="✓ Confirm Wire Fraud Insurance" icon="shield-check">
    Before wiring earnest money, verify the title company carries wire fraud insurance (minimum $1M). Get proof in writing.
    
    If fraud occurs despite following their protocols, insurance is your only recovery path.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="✓ Wire Small Test Amount First" icon="vial">
    Some banks allow test wires of $100 to verify account before sending full amount. Ask your bank if this is possible.
    
    If test wire arrives successfully, send remaining amount same day.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### After You Wire

<Steps>
  <Step title="Confirm Receipt Immediately">
    Call the title company (again, using verified phone number) to confirm they received the funds within 1-2 hours of sending.
    
    Don't wait for an email confirmation—emails can be intercepted.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get Written Confirmation">
    Request written confirmation showing your name, amount received, and date. Keep this with your closing documents.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="If Something Feels Wrong, Act Fast">
    If the title company says they haven't received funds you wired hours ago, contact your bank immediately.
    
    You have a small window (sometimes just hours) to recall a wire before it's transferred out of the fraudulent account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What to Do If You're Targeted

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Received Suspicious Email">
    **1. Don't click any links or download attachments**
    
    **2. Don't reply to the email**
    
    **3. Forward it to your title company at known email address**
    
    **4. Call them using verified phone number to report it**
    
    **5. Delete the email**
    
    The fact that you received a fake email means someone's email has been compromised—possibly theirs, possibly yours. They need to know.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Already Wired to Wrong Account">
    **1. Contact your bank immediately** (within minutes if possible)
    
    Ask them to issue wire recall. The faster you act, the higher chance of recovery.
    
    **2. Call the receiving bank** (routing number identifies them)
    
    Report fraudulent wire, request they freeze the account.
    
    **3. File police report**
    
    Local police and FBI (IC3.gov). You need this for insurance claims.
    
    **4. Notify title company's wire fraud insurance carrier**
    
    If they have coverage, this is your recovery path.
    
    **5. Contact your homeowner's insurance**
    
    Some policies cover wire fraud losses.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Prevention Failed">
    **Even if you did everything right:**
    
    If the title company's email was compromised and they had inadequate security:
    - Their wire fraud insurance should cover your loss
    - Document everything: when you called, who you spoke with, what they told you
    - Consult attorney if insurance company denies claim
    
    This is why confirming wire fraud insurance before wiring earnest money is non-negotiable.

## Questions to Ask Your Title Company

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Security Protocol" icon="user-shield">
    "Walk me through exactly how you'll communicate wiring instructions. Do you use encrypted portals or email? What verification do you require?"
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Insurance Coverage" icon="shield-check">
    "Do you carry wire fraud insurance? What's the coverage limit? Can I see proof of coverage before I wire earnest money?"
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Past Incidents" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    "Have you ever had a wire fraud incident? How was it resolved?" (Previous incidents aren't disqualifying if they have insurance and improved protocols)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Recovery Process" icon="rotate-left">
    "If I receive fake wiring instructions that appear to come from you, what's your process for recovery?" (They should have a clear plan)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The Reality

<Note>
**Most wire fraud is preventable with one simple action: verify by phone before wiring.**

The 30 seconds it takes to call and confirm could save you $50,000. There is no scenario where that phone call isn't worth your time.
</Note>

<Warning>
If your title company makes verification difficult, inconvenient, or discourages you from calling—find a different title company. Security should never be treated as an annoyance.
</Warning>
