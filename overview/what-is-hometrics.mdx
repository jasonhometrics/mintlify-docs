# What is Hometrics

Hometrics is a directory and discovery platform for real estate service providers. The platform aggregates verified reviews from Google and other sources to help consumers evaluate professionals across title, lending, insurance, legal, property management, and other real estate services.

## For Consumers

Hometrics centralizes all real estate services in one searchable directory. Instead of researching agents, lenders, title companies, insurance providers, accountants, and other professionals separately, consumers can compare options across all service categories in a single platform.

### Verified Reviews

Reviews displayed on Hometrics are pulled from verified sources like Google and other trusted platforms. The platform uses a badge system to identify authentic feedback and flag suspicious patterns.

Rankings are based on review volume, ratings, and customer feedback. Professionals cannot pay to boost their placement or hide negative reviews.

### Direct Communication

Consumers can browse profiles and initiate conversations with professionals without sharing contact information. Phone numbers and email addresses remain private until the consumer chooses to share them.

This approach prevents unsolicited calls, texts, and emails that typically follow traditional contact form submissions.

## For Professionals

Hometrics provides tools for real estate service providers to manage their online reputation and connect with potential clients.

### Profile Management

Professionals can claim their profiles to update business information, respond to reviews, and showcase credentials. Claimed profiles display verification badges and allow for direct messaging with prospective clients.

### Reputation Tools

The platform offers reputation management services including automated review collection, response management, and performance monitoring. These services help professionals build and maintain strong online presence.

### Merit-Based Visibility

Profile visibility is determined by customer reviews and ratings. Professionals with higher ratings and more verified reviews appear more prominently in search results and category listings.

## Mission and Principles

Hometrics operates on several core principles that guide platform development and policy decisions.

**Performance over popularity:** Rankings reflect service quality rather than marketing spend or industry connections.

**Transparency builds trust:** All reviews and ratings are publicly visible. The platform does not hide data or manipulate rankings based on payment.

**Merit drives momentum:** Visibility is earned through consistent service quality. Professional size or budget does not affect ranking algorithms.

**Reputation is earned:** Review authenticity is protected through verification systems. Professionals can request reviews from verified customers but cannot purchase or fabricate feedback.

**Clarity creates confidence:** Platform design assumes consumers have no industry experience. Information is presented in plain language with definitions and context.

## How Hometrics Generates Revenue

The platform offers premium services for professionals who want to enhance their profiles and accelerate review generation.

Revenue comes from:
- Reputation management subscriptions
- Enhanced profile features
- Review automation tools
- Performance analytics

Basic profile listings remain free. Professionals are automatically included in the directory based on public business information. Premium services are optional enhancements rather than requirements for visibility.

## Privacy and Data Sourcing

Hometrics aggregates information from public sources including Google Business Profiles, state licensing databases, and other publicly available business records.

Personal contact information is only shared with professionals when consumers explicitly choose to provide it. Browsing activity and profile views remain private unless a consumer initiates contact.

The platform complies with data protection regulations and provides opt-out mechanisms for professionals who prefer not to be listed.
