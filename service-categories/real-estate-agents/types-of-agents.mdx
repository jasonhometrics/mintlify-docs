Real estate agents operate under different agency relationships and business structures. Understanding these differences helps buyers and sellers choose appropriate representation.

The type of agent affects who they represent, what services they provide, and how they're compensated.

## Agency Relationships

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Buyer's agent (Selling Agent)">
    Represents the buyer in a transaction.
    
    **What they do:**
    - Help find suitable properties
    - Provide market analysis
    - Arrange showings
    - Write and negotiate offers
    - Coordinate inspections and due diligence
    - Advocate for buyer's interests
    
    **Compensation:** Typically paid from commission split at closing. Sometimes paid directly by buyer through buyer-broker agreement.
    
    **Fiduciary duty:** Owes loyalty to buyer.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Listing agent (Seller's agent)">
    Represents the seller in a transaction.
    
    **What they do:**
    - Price property through comparative market analysis
    - Market property to potential buyers
    - Manage showings and open houses
    - Review and present offers
    - Negotiate on seller's behalf
    - Coordinate transaction through closing
    
    **Compensation:** Commission percentage agreed to in listing agreement, paid at closing.
    
    **Fiduciary duty:** Owes loyalty to seller.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Dual agency">
    One agent or brokerage represents both buyer and seller in the same transaction.
    
    **When it occurs:**
    - Buyer's agent's client makes offer on listing agent's listing
    - Two agents from same brokerage represent buyer and seller
    - Agent has buyer client interested in their own listing
    
    **Legal status:** Restricted or prohibited in some states. Where allowed, requires written consent from both parties.
    
    **Considerations:**
    - Limited advocacy for either party
    - Agent cannot disclose confidential information to either side
    - Neutrality required in negotiations
    - May reduce commission paid
    
    Some buyers and sellers prefer to avoid dual agency due to inherent conflicts.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Transaction broker">
    Agent facilitates transaction without representing either party.
    
    **What they provide:**
    - Ministerial acts (paperwork, coordination)
    - Market information
    - Transaction management
    
    **What they don't provide:**
    - Advocacy for either party
    - Advice on negotiation strategy
    - Fiduciary duty
    
    **Where used:** Some states recognize this arrangement as alternative to traditional agency.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Designated agency">
    In a brokerage representing both parties, specific agents are designated to represent buyer and seller separately.
    
    - Each designated agent owes full fiduciary duty to their client
    - Agents don't share confidential information
    - Broker remains neutral
    
    Allows same brokerage to represent both sides while maintaining individual agent advocacy.
