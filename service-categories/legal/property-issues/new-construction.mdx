title: "New Construction"
description: "Builder contracts, warranties, and buyer protections"
---

Buying new construction differs from purchasing an existing home. Builder contracts favor the builder, warranties have limitations, and timelines are unpredictable.

Understanding the process helps buyers protect their interests when purchasing from a builder.

## How New Construction Differs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Builder contracts vs standard contracts">
    Builders use their own contracts, not standard real estate association forms. These contracts are written by builder's attorneys and favor the builder.

    Terms are often negotiable, but buyers must ask. Builders won't volunteer buyer-friendly changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Longer timelines">
    New construction takes months to complete. Production homes: 4-8 months. Custom homes: 8-18 months. Delays are common.

    Must coordinate sale of current home, lease endings, and financing with uncertain completion date.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deposits at risk">
    Builders require significant deposits (often 5-10% or more) that may not be fully protected if deal falls through.

    Understand when deposits become non-refundable and under what circumstances.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limited negotiation on price">
    Builders rarely negotiate base price. May offer incentives (upgrades, closing cost credits) but protect list prices to avoid affecting other sales in development.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Builder Contracts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Key provisions to review">
    - Purchase price and what's included
    - Deposit amounts and refund conditions
    - Estimated completion date
    - What constitutes "substantial completion"
    - Allowances and upgrade pricing
    - Change order procedures
    - Delay provisions
    - Walkthrough and punch list process
    - Warranty terms
    - Dispute resolution (often mandatory arbitration)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Price and inclusions">
    Base price often excludes items shown in model home. Verify what's included:

    - Landscaping
    - Appliances
    - Window treatments
    - Lighting fixtures
    - Driveway
    - Fencing
    - Finished basement or garage

    Get inclusions in writing. Model home upgrades can add 50,000+ to base price.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Allowances">
    Fixed amounts for buyer to select finishes (flooring, countertops, fixtures). If selections exceed allowance, buyer pays difference.

    Allowances are often unrealistically low. Visit design center before signing to understand true costs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Escalation clauses">
    Some contracts allow builder to increase price if material or labor costs rise. Common during volatile markets.

    Try to cap increases or add right to cancel if price rises beyond certain percentage.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Builder contracts often require mandatory arbitration and waive jury trial rights. Arbitration typically favors builders. Consider negotiating these provisions or at minimum understand what you're agreeing to.
</Warning>

## Deposits and Payments

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Deposit structure">
    Typical structure:

    - Initial deposit at contract signing (1-5%)
    - Additional deposit at certain milestones
    - Final payment at closing

    Total pre-closing deposits often 5-10% of purchase price.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Protecting deposits">
    Questions to ask:

    - Are deposits held in escrow or used by builder?
    - When do deposits become non-refundable?
    - What happens to deposit if builder defaults?
    - Is deposit protected if builder goes bankrupt?

    Request escrow holding if possible. Builders often resist.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Refund conditions">
    Most contracts limit refund to specific circumstances:

    - Financing denial (with proof of good faith effort)
    - Builder unable to deliver by outside date
    - Major specification changes by builder

    Buyer changing mind typically forfeits deposit.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Change Orders

Modifications to original plans after contract signing.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How change orders work">
    Buyer requests change. Builder provides pricing. If accepted, change order documents modification and cost adjustment.

    Changes during construction cost more than selections made before construction starts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Costs">
    Builders charge premium for changes:

    - Administrative fees
    - Markup on materials and labor
    - Delay costs if work must be redone

    Minor changes can cost hundreds. Major changes can cost thousands.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Timing limitations">
    Many changes impossible after certain construction stages. Can't move plumbing after foundation is poured. Can't change window locations after framing.

    Make decisions early. Delays in selecting finishes can delay completion.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Inspections

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Right to inspect">
    Buyers should negotiate right to have independent inspector examine property at key stages:

    - Pre-drywall (framing, electrical, plumbing visible)
    - Final walkthrough before closing

    Some builders resist pre-drywall inspections. Push for this right.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pre-drywall inspection">
    Critical inspection while framing, wiring, plumbing, and HVAC are visible. Problems found now are cheap to fix. After drywall, issues are hidden and expensive.

    Cost: \$300 - \$500. Worth every dollar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Final inspection">
    Before closing, hire inspector to identify defects for punch list. Separate from builder's walkthrough.

    Professional catches issues buyers miss. Creates documented list of items needing correction.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Municipal inspections">
    Building department inspects at required stages and issues certificate of occupancy. Passing code inspection doesn't mean quality construction.

    Code is minimum standard. Independent inspection evaluates quality.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Never skip independent inspections on new construction. "New" doesn't mean "perfect." Construction defects are common and easier to address before closing.
</Note>

## Walkthroughs and Punch Lists

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Builder walkthrough">
    Builder representative walks through home with buyer before closing. Buyer identifies cosmetic issues and incomplete items.

    Bring detailed checklist. Check every room, cabinet, fixture, outlet, and surface.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Punch list">
    Written list of items needing correction before closing. Builder agrees to complete items.

    Get punch list in writing with completion timeline. Some items may be completed after closing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What to check">
    - Paint quality and touch-ups needed
    - Drywall finishing
    - Flooring installation and condition
    - Cabinet alignment and operation
    - Countertop seams and edges
    - Fixture operation
    - Door and window operation
    - Appliance function
    - HVAC operation
    - Exterior grading and drainage
    - Driveway and walkway condition
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Closing with incomplete items">
    If punch list items aren't complete before closing, options include:

    - Delay closing until complete
    - Escrow funds for completion
    - Written agreement with completion deadline

    Avoid closing without firm commitment on open items. Leverage decreases after closing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Builder Warranties

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Typical warranty structure">
    Most builders provide tiered warranty:

    - **1 year:** Workmanship and materials
    - **2 years:** Mechanical systems (plumbing, electrical, HVAC)

    Terms vary by builder. Review specific coverage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What warranties cover">

    - Homeowner negligence
    - Cosmetic issues after move-in
    - Landscaping
    - Appliances (covered by manufacturer)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Third-party warranties">
    Some builders provide warranty through third-party companies rather than builder directly. Check:

    - Who administers claims
    - Financial backing of warranty company
    - Claims process and timelines
    - Coverage compared to builder-direct warranty
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Making warranty claims">
    Document issues in writing with photos. Submit claims promptly. Keep copies of all correspondence.

    Most warranties require written notice within specific timeframe. Verbal complaints may not preserve rights.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Warranties have exclusions and limitations. Read warranty documents carefully before closing. Some warranties require maintenance (HVAC filter changes, caulking) to remain valid.
</Warning>

## Construction Delays

<AccordionGroup>

    - Weather
    - Material shortages
    - Labor shortages

    - Subcontractor scheduling

    Delays of weeks to months are common.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Contract provisions">
    Review how contract addresses delays:

    - Is completion date firm or estimated?
    - What triggers right to cancel?
    - Are there penalties for excessive delays?
    - Who bears costs of delay (storage, extended lease)?
  </Accordion>

## Using Builder's Lender

Builders often offer incentives to use their affiliated lender. Consider carefully.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Potential benefits">
    - Closing cost credits
    - Interest rate buydowns
    - Smoother coordination with builder
    - May offer extended rate locks for construction period
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Potential drawbacks">

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Best approach">
    Get quotes from multiple lenders. Compare total cost (rate plus fees) with and without builder incentives.

    Even with incentives, outside lender may be better deal.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
