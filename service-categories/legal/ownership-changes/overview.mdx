description: "Property transfers involving death, divorce, trusts, and title changes"

Property ownership changes happen for many reasons beyond buying and selling. Death, divorce, estate planning, and family transfers all require specific legal processes to properly transfer title.

Understanding these processes helps families navigate transitions and avoid title problems.

## Key Considerations

**Title must be legally transferred.** Verbal agreements, handshakes, or family understandings don't change property ownership. A recorded deed is required.

**Mortgages don't automatically transfer.** Adding or removing names from title doesn't change who owes the debt. Lenders must approve assumptions or refinances.

**Tax implications vary.** Transfers between spouses differ from parent-to-child gifts differ from sales. Consult tax professionals before transferring.

**Title insurance matters.** Future buyers need clean title. Improperly documented transfers create problems years later.
