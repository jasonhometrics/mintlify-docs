Mortgage lending involves multiple professionals working together to evaluate, process, and approve loans. Understanding who does what clarifies communication and expectations throughout the transaction.

## Key Terms

**Mortgage Lender**
The financial institution that provides the loan funds. Banks, credit unions, and mortgage companies are lenders. They lend money and are repaid with interest over time.

**Loan Officer**
The individual who works directly with borrowers. Loan officers are employed by lenders and guide applicants through the process, collect documentation, and serve as the primary point of contact. They offer their employer's loan products.

**Mortgage Broker**
An independent intermediary who shops multiple lenders on a borrower's behalf. Brokers don't lend their own money. They submit applications to various lenders, compare options, and earn a fee for matching borrowers with financing.

Several professionals work on loan files after application. Borrowers rarely interact with them directly, but understanding their roles explains why certain requests are made.
