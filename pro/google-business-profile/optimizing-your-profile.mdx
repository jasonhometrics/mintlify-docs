title: "Optimizing Your Profile"
description: "Completing all fields and adding content that improves visibility"
---

Profile optimization means completing all available fields with accurate, detailed information. A fully optimized profile ranks better in local search, provides more useful information to consumers, and appears more credible than sparse listings.

Google rewards complete profiles with better visibility. Incomplete profiles may still appear in results but are less likely to rank prominently.

## Profile Completeness

Google indicates profile completeness in the GBP dashboard. Aim for 100% completion across all applicable sections.

## Business Description

The business description appears in search results and helps both consumers and algorithms understand what the business offers.

### Description Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Describe services clearly | Stuff keywords unnaturally |
| Include service areas if relevant | Include phone numbers or URLs |
| Mention specialties or differentiators | Use all caps or excessive punctuation |
| Write for humans first | Copy competitor descriptions |
| Keep under 750 characters | Include promotional language or prices |

## Categories

Categories tell Google what type of business this is and which searches it should appear for.

### Primary Category

The single most important category selection:

- Choose the category that best describes the core business
- This category has the strongest influence on search rankings
- Only one primary category is allowed

### Secondary Categories

Additional categories that describe other services:

- Add all relevant categories, but only categories that apply
- Helps the business appear for related searches
- Do not add aspirational or tangentially related categories

<Tip>
A title company might use "Title Company" as primary, with "Escrow Service" and "Notary Public" as secondary categories if those services are actually offered.
</Tip>

### Category Selection Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific over general">
    "Title Company" is better than "Business Service" or "Legal Service." More specific categories face less competition and match user intent better.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Match actual services">
    Only select categories for services the business actually provides. Misleading categories violate Google's guidelines.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Check competitor categories">
    Search for similar businesses and examine their category selections in their listings for ideas.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Update as services change">
    Add new categories when new services are offered. Remove categories for discontinued services.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Services and Products

The services section provides detailed information about what the business offers.

### Adding Services

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access services section">
    In the GBP dashboard, navigate to "Edit profile" and find the Services or Products section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add service categories">
    Group related services under category headings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add individual services">
    List each specific service with a name and optional description.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include pricing (optional)">
    Add price or price range if applicable and competitive.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Services must reflect actual offerings. Do not add services the business does not provide. Misleading service listings can result in poor reviews and potential guideline violations.
</Warning>

## Photos

Visual content significantly impacts listing engagement. Listings with photos receive more clicks and calls than those without.

### Photo Types to Include

| Photo Type | Purpose | Quantity |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Exterior | Help customers recognize the location | 2-3 |
| Interior | Show the office or work environment | 3-5 |
| Team | Build personal connection | 2-4 |
| Work/Projects | Demonstrate quality and expertise | 5-10 |
| Logo | Brand recognition | 1 |
| Cover photo | Featured image in listing | 1 |

### Photo Guidelines

- **Quality**: Well-lit, in-focus, professional appearance
- **Size**: Minimum 720px wide, JPG or PNG format
- **Relevance**: Show the actual business, not stock photos
- **Freshness**: Add new photos regularly (monthly if possible)

<Check>
Businesses with 100+ photos get 520% more calls than the average business, according to Google's data. Photo quantity and quality both matter.
</Check>

## Attributes

Attributes are specific characteristics that help consumers filter and choose businesses.

### Common Business Attributes

- Ownership identifiers (veteran-owned, women-owned, Black-owned)
- Accessibility features (wheelchair accessible)
- Service options (by appointment only, online appointments)
- Payment methods accepted
- Health and safety measures

### How to Add Attributes

Attributes appear in the GBP dashboard under "Edit profile." Available attributes vary by business category. Select all that accurately apply.

## Posts

GBP posts are short updates that appear on the business listing. Posts keep the profile active and can highlight timely information.

### Post Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Updates" icon="bullhorn">
    General announcements, news, or information sharing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Events" icon="calendar">
    Upcoming events with dates, times, and details
  </Card>
  <Card title="Offers" icon="tag">
    Promotions, discounts, or special deals with expiration dates
  </Card>
  <Card title="Products" icon="box">
    Highlight specific products or services
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Post Best Practices

- Include a photo with every post
- Keep text concise (150-300 words)
- Include a call to action when appropriate
- Post at least monthly to maintain activity
- Update or remove expired offers promptly

<Info>
Posts expire after 7 days (offers) or 6 months (other types). Regular posting keeps fresh content visible and signals active management.
</Info>

## Hours and Special Hours

Accurate hours prevent customer frustration and build trust.

### Regular Hours

- Enter hours for each day of the week
- Use "Closed" for days the business does not operate
- Be precise about opening and closing times

### Special Hours

- Add hours for holidays before they occur
- Include early closures or extended hours
- Update for temporary schedule changes

<Tip>
Set a calendar reminder to update holiday hours at least one week in advance. Incorrect holiday hours lead to negative experiences and reviews.
