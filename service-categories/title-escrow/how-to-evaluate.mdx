## How to Evaluate Title & Escrow Companies

Title and escrow companies handle significant sums and verify critical legal details. The company selected determines transaction security, accuracy of ownership transfer, and protection against fraud.

Evaluating options requires asking specific questions about security protocols, insurance coverage, experience, and closing procedures. Most parties in real estate transactions accept referrals without verification. This creates unnecessary risk when tens of thousands of dollars and legal ownership are at stake.

## What to Evaluate

- **Security and fraud protection** - Wire fraud cost homebuyers over \$350 million in 2023. Companies must have encrypted communication, verification protocols, and insurance coverage.
- **Title research accuracy** - Thorough searches uncover ownership problems before closing. Missed issues become legal and financial burdens after transfer.
- **Settlement expertise** - Licensed settlement agents can explain documents and answer questions. Notaries only witness signatures without providing guidance.
- **Local experience** - Companies embedded in local markets understand county-specific requirements, recording procedures, and common title issues.
- **Fee transparency** - Costs vary significantly between companies. Clear breakdowns prevent surprises at closing.

## Essential Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Security and Wire Fraud Protection">
    **"What security measures protect wire transfers?"**

    Look for:

    - Encrypted portals for document sharing and wire instructions
    - Phone verification protocols (never trust emailed wire instructions alone)
    - Multi-factor authentication for account access
    - Staff training on fraud prevention

    **"Do you carry wire fraud insurance? What's the coverage amount?"**

    This is non-negotiable. If funds are stolen due to security breaches, insurance protects the transaction. Companies without coverage pass all risk to clients.

    **"How do you communicate wire instructions?"**

    Best practice: Secure portal delivery with mandatory phone verification using independently looked-up numbers. Red flag: Email-only communication.

    **"Have you had any wire fraud incidents? How were they resolved?"**

    Companies should answer transparently. No incidents doesn't mean strong security. It might mean low volume or unreported problems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Experience and Track Record">
    **"How many closings do you handle monthly?"**

    Volume indicates experience with various scenarios. Companies closing 50+ transactions monthly have seen most complications and know how to resolve them.

    **"How long have you operated in this market?"**

    Local experience matters. Companies familiar with county recording offices, local title issues, and regional customs prevent delays.

    **"What percentage of your closings occur on the scheduled date?"**

    On-time closing rates above 95% indicate reliable processes and experienced coordination.

    **"Can you provide references from recent transactions?"**

    Request contact information for 2-3 recent clients. Ask about communication, problem-solving, and any surprises.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Settlement and Closing Procedures">
    **"Who conducts the closing? A licensed settlement agent or a notary?"**

    Licensed settlement agents can explain documents, answer legal questions, and provide guidance. Notaries only witness signatures.

    **"What happens if questions arise during closing?"**

    Settlement agents resolve issues on the spot. Notaries cannot provide answers, which delays resolution and creates stress.

    **"Are evening or weekend closings available?"**

    Flexibility accommodates parties with scheduling constraints. Limited availability may force inconvenient timing.

    **"What documents will I review before closing day?"**

    Best practice: Settlement statements and closing documents available 24-48 hours in advance for review.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Title Research and Insurance">
    **"What's included in your title search?"**

    Comprehensive searches review:

    - Ownership history (typically 30-60 years)
    - Outstanding liens and judgments
    - Unpaid taxes and assessments
    - Easements and restrictions
    - Legal descriptions and surveys

    **"How do you handle title defects discovered before closing?"**

    Experienced companies resolve most issues (paying off liens, obtaining releases, correcting errors) without delaying closing.

    **"What title insurance options do you offer?"**

    Standard coverage protects against defects in public records. Enhanced coverage adds protection for survey issues, building permit violations, and post-policy forgery.

    **"What's your claims process if title issues arise after closing?"**

    Understand response time, documentation requirements, and how disputes are resolved.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Communication and Accessibility">
    **"Who is my main point of contact throughout the transaction?"**

    Single point of contact ensures continuity. Multiple handoffs increase miscommunication risk.

    **"How quickly do you respond to questions?"**

    Same-day response during business hours is standard. Next-day response acceptable for non-urgent matters.

    **"How do you keep parties updated on transaction progress?"**

    Proactive communication (weekly updates, milestone notifications) prevents surprises and reduces stress.

    **"What happens if problems arise outside business hours?"**

    Know who to contact and expected response time for urgent issues.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fees and Costs">
    **"Can you provide a detailed fee breakdown?"**

    Request itemized estimates including:

    - Title search fee
    - Title insurance premiums (lender's and owner's)
    - Settlement/closing fee
    - Document preparation
    - Recording fees
    - Wire transfer fees
    - Any additional charges

    **"Which fees are negotiable?"**

    Settlement fees and some service charges may be negotiable. Title insurance rates are often state-regulated.

    **"Are there circumstances where fees could increase?"**

    Understand potential additional costs (complex title issues, rush orders, amended documents).

    **"When is payment due?"**

    Most fees are paid at closing. Confirm no upfront costs required beyond standard deposits.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Red Flags vs Green Flags

<Warning>
  **Red Flags - Avoid companies that:**

  - Have no wire fraud insurance or won't disclose coverage
  - Use email-only communication for wire instructions
  - Cannot explain security protocols clearly
  - Send notaries instead of settlement agents to closings
  - Provide vague answers about experience or volume
  - Won't share recent client references
  - Have unclear or incomplete fee breakdowns
  - Show poor responsiveness during initial inquiries
  - Cannot accommodate reasonable scheduling requests
  - Have negative reviews mentioning fraud, delays, or errors
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Green Flags - Look for companies that:**

  - Carry comprehensive wire fraud insurance
  - Use encrypted portals and phone verification
  - Employ licensed settlement agents for closings
  - Close 50+ transactions monthly in your market
  - Provide detailed security protocol explanations
  - Offer client references willingly
  - Deliver transparent, itemized fee breakdowns
  - Respond within hours to inquiries
  - Accommodate evening/weekend closings when needed
  - Have consistent positive reviews about security and service
</Tip>

## Comparing Multiple Companies

Research at least three companies before selecting one. Use this framework:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Schedule consultations with three companies">
    Request 20-30 minute calls or meetings. Ask the same questions to each for direct comparison.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request fee estimates for your specific transaction">
    Provide identical information (property address, purchase price, loan amount) to each company. Compare total costs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify insurance and licensing">
    Confirm wire fraud insurance coverage amounts. Verify settlement agents are properly licensed in your state.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Read reviews and check references">
    Focus on recent reviews mentioning security, communication, and problem resolution. Call provided references.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test responsiveness">
    Companies slow to respond during the sales process rarely improve once they have your business.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When to Start Research

Begin researching title companies before writing offers. Once contracts are executed, earnest money deposits are due within 3 business days. This timeline doesn't allow adequate comparison, verification, or due diligence.

Early research provides:

- Time to verify security protocols without pressure
- Ability to compare fees from multiple companies
- Opportunity to read reviews and check references
- Confidence when selecting during time-sensitive negotiations

## The Bottom Line

Title and escrow company selection directly impacts transaction security and success. Wire fraud protection, title accuracy, and settlement expertise are non-negotiable requirements.

Ask specific questions about security protocols, insurance coverage, and closing procedures. Compare multiple companies before deciding. Verify rather than trust referrals.

When significant sums and legal ownership are at stake, thorough evaluation prevents costly problems.
