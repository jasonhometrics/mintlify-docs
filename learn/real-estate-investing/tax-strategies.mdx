## Tax Advantages of Real Estate Investing

Real estate offers tax benefits not available with other investment types. Deductions, depreciation, and deferral strategies can significantly reduce tax liability and increase after-tax returns.

Tax laws are complex and change frequently. This overview covers key concepts. Work with a [tax professional](/service-categories/accountants-tax/overview) familiar with real estate to optimize your specific situation.

## Rental Income and Expenses

Rental income is taxable, but most operating expenses are deductible, reducing taxable income.

### Deductible Expenses

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Repairs vs. Improvements

The distinction between repairs and improvements affects when costs are deductible.

| Repairs (Deduct Immediately) | Improvements (Capitalize and Depreciate) |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Fixing broken items          | Adding new features                      |
| Repainting                   | Renovating rooms                         |
| Patching roof leaks          | Replacing entire roof                    |
| Replacing broken window      | Adding windows                           |
| Fixing plumbing leaks        | Replumbing the house                     |
| HVAC repairs                 | New HVAC system                          |

<Note>
  Improvements must be capitalized and depreciated over time rather than deducted immediately. The distinction matters for tax timing.
</Note>

## Depreciation

Depreciation allows investors to deduct a portion of the property's value each year, even though the property may be appreciating in market value.

### How Depreciation Works

Residential rental property depreciates over 27.5 years. Only the building value depreciates; land does not depreciate.

**Example calculation:**

| Item                | Amount                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Purchase price      | \$250,000                  |
| Land value (20%)    | \$50,000                   |
| Building value      | \$200,000                  |
| Annual depreciation | \$7,273 (\$200,000 ÷ 27.5) |

This \$7,273 annual deduction reduces taxable rental income without any cash outlay.

### Starting Depreciation

Depreciation begins when the property is placed in service (available for rent), not when purchased. If you buy in June and have it rent-ready in August, depreciation starts in August.

For the first and last year, depreciation is prorated based on the month placed in service using IRS tables.

### Cost Segregation

Cost segregation studies identify components of a property that can be depreciated faster than 27.5 years.

**Shorter depreciation lives:**

- Land improvements (parking, landscaping): 15 years
- Personal property (appliances, carpeting): 5-7 years
- Certain building components: Various

**Benefits:**

- Accelerates deductions to earlier years
- Improves early cash flow
- Particularly valuable for higher-cost properties

**Considerations:**

- Studies cost \$3,000-15,000+
- Most beneficial for properties over \$500,000
- Consult with a [tax professional](/service-categories/accountants-tax/types-of-tax-professionals) to evaluate ROI

### Bonus Depreciation

Bonus depreciation allows immediate deduction of certain asset costs rather than depreciating over time. Rules change frequently; consult current tax law for applicable percentages and qualifying assets.

## Depreciation Recapture

When you sell a rental property, depreciation claimed during ownership is "recaptured" and taxed.

**How it works:**

- Depreciation reduces your cost basis over time
- When selling, gain is calculated using adjusted (lower) basis
- Depreciation recapture is taxed at up to 25%
- Remaining gain above original purchase price is taxed at capital gains rates

**Example:**

| Item                                        | Amount    |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Original purchase price                     | \$200,000 |
| Depreciation claimed over 10 years          | \$50,000  |
| Adjusted basis                              | \$150,000 |
| Sale price                                  | \$280,000 |
| Total gain                                  | \$130,000 |
| Depreciation recapture (taxed at up to 25%) | \$50,000  |
| Capital gain (taxed at capital gains rates) | \$80,000  |

<Warning>
  Depreciation is recaptured whether or not you actually claimed it. The IRS assumes you took allowed depreciation. Always claim depreciation on rental property.
</Warning>

## 1031 Exchanges

A [1031 exchange](/service-categories/accountants-tax/1031-exchanges) (also called a like-kind exchange) allows investors to defer capital gains taxes by reinvesting sale proceeds into another investment property.

### How 1031 Exchanges Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sell the relinquished property">
    List and sell your current investment property. The sale proceeds go to a qualified intermediary, not to you directly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify replacement property">
    Within 45 days of selling, identify potential replacement properties in writing to the qualified intermediary. You can identify up to three properties (or more under certain rules).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Close on replacement property">
    Close on one or more replacement properties within 180 days of selling the original property.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Defer the gain">
    If done correctly, capital gains tax is deferred. The basis in the new property is reduced by the deferred gain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 1031 Requirements

| Requirement                | Details                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Like-kind property         | Real estate for real estate (broad definition)                |
| Investment or business use | Cannot exchange primary residence                             |
| Qualified intermediary     | Must use third-party intermediary; cannot touch funds         |
| 45-day identification      | Must identify replacement in writing within 45 days           |
| 180-day closing            | Must close on replacement within 180 days                     |
| Equal or greater value     | To defer all gain, replacement must be equal or greater value |
| Reinvest all proceeds      | Cash received ("boot") is taxable                             |

### Partial Exchanges

If you do not reinvest all proceeds or buy a less expensive property, you pay tax on the difference ("boot").

**Example:**

- Sell property for \$400,000
- Buy replacement for \$350,000
- Boot (taxable): \$50,000

### Deferral, Not Elimination

1031 exchanges defer taxes; they do not eliminate them. The deferred gain carries forward to the replacement property. However, investors can continue exchanging indefinitely, and the gain may never be taxed if:

- The investor dies (heirs receive stepped-up basis)
- The property is eventually converted to personal use after holding requirements
- Future tax law changes

## Passive Activity Rules

Rental income is generally considered passive income, subject to special rules.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Passive loss limitations">
    Losses from passive activities (like rentals) can only offset passive income, not wages or other active income. Excess losses carry forward to future years.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="$25,000 allowance">
    Taxpayers who actively participate in rental activities can deduct up to \$25,000 in rental losses against non-passive income. This phases out for adjusted gross income between \$100,000 and \$150,000.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Real estate professional status">
    Taxpayers who qualify as real estate professionals can treat rental income as non-passive, allowing losses to offset other income without limitation.

    **Requirements:**

    - More than 50% of personal services performed in real estate trades or businesses
    - More than 750 hours per year in real estate activities
    - Material participation in rental activities

    This status is valuable for high-income investors with rental losses but difficult to achieve for those with full-time jobs in other fields.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Qualified Business Income Deduction

The Section 199A deduction allows eligible taxpayers to deduct up to 20% of qualified business income from pass-through entities, including rental income in some cases.

**Eligibility factors:**

- Rental activity must rise to the level of a trade or business
- Income thresholds affect the deduction
- W-2 wage and property basis limitations may apply at higher incomes

<Note>
  Whether rental income qualifies for the QBI deduction depends on facts and circumstances. Consult a [tax professional](/service-categories/accountants-tax/comparing-accountants) for your specific situation.
</Note>

## Tax Planning Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Time purchases strategically">
    Buying late in the year still allows a full year of depreciation expense in some cases. Consult with your accountant on optimal timing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Maintain excellent records">
    Track all expenses with receipts and documentation. Missed deductions are lost money.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Separate properties in accounting">
    Track income and expenses by property for accurate analysis and tax reporting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider entity structure">
    [LLCs](/service-categories/legal/property-issues/llcs-and-business-structures), S-corps, and other structures affect tax treatment. Plan entity structure with tax implications in mind.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Plan for depreciation recapture">
    When selling, factor recapture taxes into net proceeds calculations. Consider 1031 exchange to defer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Work with specialists">
    Real estate tax rules are complex. A [CPA or tax attorney](/service-categories/accountants-tax/types-of-tax-professionals) specializing in real estate can identify savings that exceed their fees.
  </Accordion>
