Google Business Profile provides analytics that show how customers find and interact with a listing. These insights help measure the effectiveness of optimization efforts and identify areas for improvement.

GBP Insights are accessible through the GBP dashboard and provide data on searches, views, and customer actions.

## Accessing Insights

GBP Insights are available in multiple locations:

- **GBP Dashboard**: Navigate to business.google.com and select "Insights" or "Performance"
- **Google Search**: Search for the business while signed in, click "View profile," then "Performance"
- **Google Maps App**: Open the listing while signed in as the manager

<Info>
  Data typically updates within 24-48 hours. Some metrics may show delays of up to 72 hours during high-volume periods.
</Info>

## Key Metrics

GBP tracks several categories of performance data:

### Discovery Metrics

How customers find the listing:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Search Views" icon="magnifying-glass">
    How many times the listing appeared in search results
  </Card>
  <Card title="Maps Views" icon="map">
    How many times the listing appeared in Google Maps
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

| Metric             | Description                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Direct searches    | Searches for the business name or address    |
| Discovery searches | Searches for a category, product, or service |
| Branded searches   | Searches for a brand related to the business |

<Tip>
  A high ratio of discovery searches to direct searches indicates the listing is being found by potential new customers, not just existing ones looking up contact information.
</Tip>

### Customer Actions

What customers do after viewing the listing:

| Action             | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Website clicks     | Clicks on the website link                     |
| Direction requests | Clicks on the directions button                |
| Phone calls        | Clicks on the call button                      |
| Messages           | Messages sent through GBP messaging            |
| Bookings           | Bookings made through integrated booking tools |

### Search Queries

The actual terms people searched before seeing the listing. This data helps understand:

- Which services are generating visibility
- Whether category and service optimizations are working
- Potential gaps in service coverage
- Keywords to emphasize in the profile

<Warning>
  Search query data is sampled and may not include every search that led to the listing. Use it to identify trends rather than exact counts.
</Warning>

## Interpreting the Data

### Baseline Establishment

Before measuring improvement, establish baseline metrics:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Record current metrics">
    Document current values for views, searches, and actions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note the date">
    Mark when optimization efforts began.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare monthly">
    Review metrics monthly against the baseline.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Account for seasonality">
    Compare to the same period last year if data is available.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Healthy Metrics Patterns

Signs of a well-performing profile:

<Check>
  **Positive indicators:**

  - Growing search views over time
  - Discovery searches increasing faster than direct searches
  - Consistent customer actions (calls, clicks, directions)
  - Search queries matching target services
  - High percentage of views converting to actions
</Check>

### Warning Signs

Signs that require attention:

- <Tooltip tip="">Declining views without seasonal explanation</Tooltip>
- <Tooltip tip="">Low action rate relative to views</Tooltip>
- <Tooltip tip="">Search queries that do not match business services</Tooltip>
- <Tooltip tip="">Significant drops after Google algorithm updates</Tooltip>
- <Tooltip tip="">Views concentrated in direct searches only</Tooltip>

## Tracking Visibility Over Time

Create a simple tracking system:

### Monthly Tracking Spreadsheet

```
| Month    | Search Views | Maps Views | Website | Calls | Directions |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------|-------|------------|
| Jan 2025 | 1,200       | 800        | 150     | 45    | 30         |
| Feb 2025 | 1,350       | 850        | 175     | 52    | 28         |
| Mar 2025 | 1,500       | 920        | 190     | 60    | 35         |
```

<Info>
  Tracking over time reveals trends that single-point data cannot show. Gradual improvement indicates optimization is working. Sudden drops may indicate issues requiring investigation.
</Info>

### Key Ratios to Monitor

| Ratio           | Calculation                                 | Target             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Action Rate     | (Calls + Clicks + Directions) / Total Views | 3-10%              |
| Discovery Ratio | Discovery Searches / Total Searches         | Higher is better   |
| Call-to-View    | Calls / Total Views                         | Industry dependent |

## Using Insights for Optimization

Insights data informs optimization decisions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Low search views">
    The listing is not appearing frequently in search results.

    **Actions**: Review category selection, add more relevant services, increase review activity, check for [NAP consistency](/pro/business-listings/overview#nap-consistency) issues.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="High views but low actions">
    People see the listing but do not engage.

    **Actions**: Improve photos, enhance description, verify hours are accurate, ensure phone number is clickable, check reviews for concerns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Irrelevant search queries">
    Appearing for searches unrelated to actual services.

    **Actions**: Review and correct category selections, update services list, revise description to be more specific.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing target queries">
    Not appearing for desired service terms.

    **Actions**: Add relevant services, ensure description includes key terms naturally, check that category matches target services.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Competitive Context

Insights show individual performance but not competitive positioning. To understand competitive context:

- Search for target keywords and note ranking position in the Map Pack
- Compare review counts and ratings to competitors
- Evaluate competitor profile completeness
- Monitor position changes over time

<Tip>
  Track Map Pack position for 3-5 key search terms weekly. Note whether the business appears in positions 1-3, 4-7, or not at all. This provides competitive context that Insights alone do not offer.
</Tip>

## Beyond GBP Insights

Additional data sources complement GBP Insights:

| Source                | Data Provided                                |

| Google Search Console | Organic search visibility                    |
| Call tracking         | Detailed call analytics beyond click counts  |
| CRM                   | Lead quality and conversion from GBP sources |

1. Use UTM parameters on the GBP website link to track in Google Analytics
