Mortgage loans come in various types, each with different requirements, benefits, and trade-offs. The right loan depends on credit profile, down payment, military service, property location, and financial goals.

Loan officers help match borrowers with appropriate programs, but understanding the options enables better conversations and informed decisions.

## Government-Backed vs Conventional

Mortgage loans fall into two broad categories:

**Conventional loans** are not insured or guaranteed by the federal government. They follow guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises that purchase loans from lenders.

**Government-backed loans** are insured or guaranteed by federal agencies (FHA, VA, USDA). This insurance protects lenders against default, allowing more flexible qualification requirements.

## Fixed vs Adjustable Rates

Beyond loan programs, mortgages differ in how interest rates behave over time.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fixed Rate" icon="lock">
    - Interest rate never changes
    - Payment stays constant
    - Protection from rate increases
    - Higher initial rate than adjustable
    - Common terms: 15, 20, 30 years
  </Card>
  <Card title="Adjustable Rate (ARM)" icon="chart-line">
    - Rate fixed for initial period, then adjusts
    - Lower initial rate than fixed
    - Rate can increase or decrease
    - Caps limit adjustment amounts
    - Common terms: 5/1, 7/1, 10/1 ARMs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Understanding ARM notation:** A 5/1 ARM has a fixed rate for 5 years, then adjusts annually. A 7/1 ARM is fixed for 7 years, then adjusts annually.

**When fixed rates make sense:**

- Planning to stay long-term
- Prefer payment predictability
- Current rates are favorable
- Risk tolerance is low

**When ARMs may make sense:**

- Planning to sell or refinance before adjustment period
- Need lower initial payment to qualify
- Rates are expected to decrease
- Comfortable with potential payment changes

## Choosing the Right Loan

Loan selection depends on individual circumstances:

| Situation                                | Programs to Consider   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Strong credit, 20% down                  | Conventional           |
| Limited down payment, good credit        | Conventional 3% or FHA |
| Lower credit scores                      | FHA                    |
| Veteran or active military               | VA                     |
| Rural/suburban property, moderate income | USDA                   |
| High-value property                      | Jumbo                  |

Multiple programs may be available for the same borrower. Loan officers should present options with cost comparisons over time, not just monthly payments.

## Questions to Ask

When discussing loan types with a loan officer:

**"Which programs am I eligible for?"** Multiple options may exist. Understanding all possibilities enables informed comparison.

**"Can you show me total cost over 5, 10, and 30 years for each option?"** Monthly payment doesn't tell the full story. Mortgage insurance, rates, and fees affect total cost.

**"What are the trade-offs between these programs?"** Each program has benefits and drawbacks. Loan officers should explain both.

**"What happens if my situation changes?"** Refinancing options, PMI removal, and rate adjustment impacts vary by program.
