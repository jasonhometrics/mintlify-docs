title: "Types of Listings"
description: "Categories of business listing platforms including directories, aggregators, and social profiles"
---

Business listings exist across multiple platform types, each serving different purposes and audiences. Understanding these categories helps prioritize which listings to claim and maintain.

The major categories include general directories, industry-specific platforms, social profiles, and data aggregators. Each plays a distinct role in the [local search ecosystem](/pro/business-listings/overview#the-listing-ecosystem).

## General Directories

General directories list businesses across all industries and serve broad consumer audiences. These platforms typically include review functionality and appear prominently in search results.

### Major General Directories

| Platform | Key Features | Priority Level |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Google Business Profile | Search, Maps, reviews, posts, Q&A | Critical |
| Yelp | Reviews, photos, messaging | High |
| Bing Places | Bing search, Cortana voice | High |
| Apple Business Connect | Apple Maps, Siri voice | High |
| Better Business Bureau | Accreditation, complaint resolution | Medium |
| Yellow Pages / YP.com | Legacy directory, still indexed | Medium |
| MapQuest | Navigation, local search | Low |

<Info>
[Google Business Profile](/pro/google-business-profile/overview) warrants its own dedicated section due to its outsized influence on local search visibility. It serves as the primary data source for Google Search, Google Maps, and many AI tools.
</Info>

### Claiming General Directory Listings

Most general directories allow businesses to claim and manage their listings for free. The process typically involves:

1. Searching for the business on the platform
2. Clicking "Claim this business" or similar
3. Verifying ownership via phone, postcard, or email
4. Completing profile information

<Tip>
Claim listings on Google, Bing, Apple, and Yelp first. These platforms have the highest visibility and influence other data sources. See [Auditing Your Listings](/pro/business-listings/auditing-your-listings) for a complete audit process.
</Tip>

## Industry-Specific Directories

Industry directories focus on specific professional categories. For real estate service providers, these platforms attract consumers actively researching that service type.

### Benefits of Industry Directories

Industry-specific platforms offer advantages over general directories:

- **Higher intent audience**: Consumers searching these sites are actively seeking that service
- **Relevant context**: Listings appear alongside industry-appropriate information
- **Credibility signals**: Association directories imply professional membership or licensing
- **Less competition**: Fewer total listings than general directories

<Warning>
Verify that industry directory listings match your [NAP information](/pro/business-listings/overview#nap-consistency) exactly. Inconsistencies between general and industry directories create the same problems as any other mismatch.
</Warning>

## Social Platforms

Social media platforms function as business directories in addition to their primary social features. Consumers discover and research businesses through these channels.

### Platforms with Business Listings

| Platform | Listing Features | Best For |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| Facebook | Business pages, reviews, messaging | Broad consumer reach |
| LinkedIn | Company pages, employee connections | B2B services, professional credibility |
| Instagram | Business profiles, location tags | Visual services (staging, design) |
| Nextdoor | Local business pages, recommendations | Neighborhood-focused services |

### Social Profile Considerations

Social platforms require more active management than directory listings:

- Posts and updates expected (inactive profiles appear abandoned)
- Direct messaging requires monitoring
- Reviews and recommendations need responses
- Profile information must stay current

<Info>
Social profiles contribute to the overall online presence that search engines evaluate for [prominence](/pro/local-search/overview#prominence). Even if a platform is not a primary lead source, maintaining accurate information supports local SEO.
</Info>

## Data Aggregators

<Tooltip tip="Companies that collect business information and distribute it to multiple directories, apps, and platforms">Data aggregators</Tooltip> collect business information and distribute it to networks of directories, apps, and data partners. Submitting to aggregators can update dozens of listings simultaneously.

### Major Data Aggregators

| Aggregator | Distribution Network |
|------------|---------------------|
| Data Axle (formerly Infogroup) | Major directories, GPS systems, apps |
| Neustar Localeze | Search engines, directories, voice assistants |
| Foursquare | Location-based apps, navigation systems |
| Factual (now Foursquare) | Apps, platforms requiring location data |

### How Aggregators Work

```

              ↓
    Aggregator verifies and stores
              ↓
