title: "Pricing and Listing"
description: "Setting the right price and going to market"

Pricing strategy directly affects how long a property sits on market and what offers it receives. Once the price is set and the property goes live, the listing agent manages showings, collects feedback, and adjusts strategy as needed.

## How Pricing Can Affect Time on Market

Properties priced correctly from the start typically sell faster and for closer to asking price than those that start high and reduce later.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Overpriced properties">
    - Sit longer on market
    - Attract fewer showings
    - Buyers assume something is wrong
    - Eventually sell for less than if priced correctly initially
    - Create "stale listing" perception
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Underpriced properties">
    - Generate more interest and showings
    - May attract multiple offers
    - Competition can drive price above asking
    - Risk leaving money on the table in slow markets
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Correctly priced properties">
    - Attract qualified buyers quickly
    - Generate reasonable showing activity
    - Sell within expected timeframe
    - Close at or near asking price
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Comparative Market Analysis

A comparative market analysis (CMA) is a report comparing your property to similar recently sold homes to estimate market value. Your listing agent prepares this to recommend a listing price.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What a CMA includes">
    - Recently sold comparable properties
    - Active listings (your competition)
    - Pending sales (under contract)
    - Expired listings (failed to sell)
    - Adjustments for differences in features, condition, location
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How agents select comparables">
    - Similar square footage and lot size
    - Same neighborhood or comparable area
    - Similar age and condition
    - Sold within past 3-6 months
    - Similar features (bedrooms, bathrooms, garage)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CMA vs appraisal">
    A CMA is an agent's opinion of value based on market data. An appraisal is a licensed appraiser's formal valuation. CMAs are free and useful for pricing decisions but are not accepted for lending or legal purposes.

## Listing Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Price at market value">
    List at the price supported by comparable sales. Standard approach that attracts serious buyers and typically results in offers near asking price.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Price slightly below market">
    List below comparable sales to generate interest and potentially multiple offers. Works best in competitive markets where bidding wars are common.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Price above market">
    List higher than comparables support, planning to negotiate down. Risky strategy that often backfires. Overpriced homes sit longer and often sell for less than if priced correctly from the start.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Coming soon">
    Market the property before officially listing on MLS. Builds anticipation but limits exposure. Some markets restrict this practice.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Timing Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Seasonal patterns">
    Spring and early summer typically see more buyer activity. Fall can be strong. Winter tends to be slower but has less competition. Local patterns vary.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Market conditions">
    In a seller's market (low inventory, high demand), timing matters less. In a buyer's market (high inventory, low demand), strategic timing and pricing become more important.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personal circumstances">
    Job relocation, school schedules, lease expirations, and other factors may dictate timing regardless of market conditions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What to Expect Once Listed

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MLS and syndication">
    Your listing goes live on the Multiple Listing Service and syndicates to major real estate websites (Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin). Most buyer interest comes within the first two weeks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Showings">
    Buyer's agents schedule appointments through your listing agent or a showing service. Be prepared to vacate on short notice. More showings typically mean better pricing and marketing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Open houses">
    Public events where buyers can view the property without appointments. Generate exposure but attract a mix of serious buyers and casual lookers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Feedback">
    Your agent collects feedback from buyer's agents after showings. Common themes help identify whether price, condition, or other factors need adjustment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Offers">
    Offers can arrive at any time. Your agent presents each offer with analysis of price, terms, contingencies, and buyer qualification.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## If the Property Isn't Selling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Price reduction">
    If showings are low or feedback consistently mentions price, a reduction may be needed. Small reductions rarely help. Significant reductions generate renewed interest.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Marketing adjustment">
    New photos, updated description, additional advertising, or different showing availability may help if the issue isn't price.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Condition issues">
    If feedback mentions condition concerns, addressing those issues or adjusting price to reflect them may be necessary.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Taking it off market">
    In some cases, withdrawing the listing and relisting later as "new" can reset buyer perception. Discuss timing and strategy with your agent.
