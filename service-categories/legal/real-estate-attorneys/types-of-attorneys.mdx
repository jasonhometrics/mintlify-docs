## Overlapping Expertise

Many attorneys practice across multiple areas. A residential transaction attorney may also handle:

- Simple landlord-tenant matters
- Basic estate transfers
- Title issue resolution
- Contract disputes

Complex matters often benefit from specialists, but general real estate attorneys can handle many common situations.

## Choosing the Right Specialization

| Situation | Specialization Needed |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Buying or selling a home | Residential transaction |
| Purchasing commercial property | Commercial real estate |
| Contract dispute heading to court | Real estate litigation |
| Seeking zoning variance | Land use and zoning |
| Evicting a tenant | Landlord-tenant |
| Transferring property to trust | Estate planning |
| Title defect blocking sale | Title attorney |
| Construction defect claim | Construction attorney |

## General Practice vs Specialists

**General real estate attorneys:**
- Handle variety of matters
- Good for straightforward situations
- May refer complex issues to specialists
- Often more accessible and affordable

**Specialists:**
- Deep expertise in specific area
- Handle complex or high-stakes matters
- May have higher fees
- Often necessary for litigation or unusual transactions

<Note>
For most residential transactions, a general real estate attorney with transaction experience is sufficient. Specialists become important when matters involve litigation, complex business structures, development, or unusual legal issues.
</Note>

## Questions to Ask

When contacting an attorney, clarify their experience with your specific situation:

**"What percentage of your practice involves [your type of matter]?"**
Ensures relevant experience, not occasional dabbling.

**"Have you handled situations similar to mine?"**
Specific experience matters more than general credentials.

**"Will you personally handle my matter or will it be assigned to another attorney?"**
Larger firms may assign work to associates.

**"Do you have relationships with specialists if my matter becomes more complex?"**
Good generalists know when to refer.
