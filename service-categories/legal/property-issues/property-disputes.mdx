title: "Property Disputes"
description: "Boundary conflicts, easements, and neighbor issues"
---

Property disputes arise when owners disagree about boundaries, access, use, or interference with their land. These conflicts can simmer for years or escalate quickly, affecting property value and quality of life.

Understanding common disputes and resolution options helps owners protect their interests.

## Boundary Disputes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How they arise">
    - Fences built in wrong location
    - Surveys show different boundary than assumed
    - Neighbors disagree about property line
    - Structures or landscaping cross boundary
    - Legal description doesn't match physical markers
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Getting a survey">
    Professional survey determines actual boundary location. Licensed surveyors research deeds and physically mark property lines.

    Cost typically \$300 - \$800 for residential lots. More for large or complex parcels.

    Survey provides legal documentation if dispute escalates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Resolution options">
    - **Negotiate:** Agree on boundary with neighbor, formalize with boundary line agreement
    - **Adjust:** One party purchases strip of land from other
    - **Quiet title action:** Court determines ownership
    - **Accept encroachment:** Grant easement for existing structure
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Encroachments

An encroachment occurs when a structure, fence, or landscaping crosses onto neighboring property.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Common encroachments">
    - Fences built over property line
    - Driveways extending onto neighbor's land
    - Tree branches or roots crossing boundary
    - Building eaves, gutters, or foundations
    - Sheds or outbuildings
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Discovering encroachments">
    Often discovered during sale when buyer orders survey or title search reveals issues. May also arise when neighbor builds or improves property.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Resolution options">
    - **Remove:** Encroaching party removes structure (required if minor and recently built)
    - **Purchase:** Encroaching party buys affected land
    - **Easement:** Property owner grants easement allowing encroachment to remain
    - **Do nothing:** Risky; may lead to adverse possession claim over time
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Ignoring encroachments can create bigger problems. In some states, long-term encroachments can lead to adverse possession claims where the encroaching party gains legal ownership of the land.
</Warning>

## Easements

An easement grants someone the right to use another person's land for a specific purpose.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Types of easements">
    - **Utility easements:** Allow utility companies to install and maintain lines
    - **Access easements:** Grant right to cross property (often for landlocked parcels)
    - **Drainage easements:** Allow water flow across property
    - **Conservation easements:** Restrict development to protect natural resources
    - **Prescriptive easements:** Acquired through long-term open use without permission
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How easements are created">
    - **Express grant:** Written agreement between parties
    - **Reservation:** Previous owner keeps right when selling
    - **Necessity:** Court grants access to landlocked property
    - **Prescription:** Long-term use (typically 10-20 years) creates legal right
    - **Implication:** Circumstances suggest easement was intended
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Easement disputes">
    Common conflicts include:

    - Scope of use (what's allowed under easement)
    - Maintenance responsibility
    - Interference with easement rights
    - Attempts to expand easement beyond original purpose
    - Blocking or limiting access
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Terminating easements">
    Easements can end by:

    - Written release from easement holder
    - Merger (same person owns both properties)
    - Abandonment (non-use plus intent to abandon)
    - Expiration (if time-limited)
    - Court order

    Most easements run with the land indefinitely.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tree and Vegetation Disputes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Overhanging branches">
    Property owners generally can trim branches that cross onto their property, up to the property line.

    Cannot trespass to trim. Cannot damage tree's health. Check local regulations before cutting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Roots causing damage">
    Tree roots crossing boundary and causing damage (cracked foundations, lifted sidewalks) can create liability for tree owner in some jurisdictions.

    Rules vary by state. Some place responsibility on affected property owner.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fallen trees">
    If healthy tree falls due to storm, tree owner typically not liable. If tree was dead, diseased, or obviously hazardous, owner may be responsible for damage.

    Document tree conditions and notify neighbor in writing if concerned about hazardous tree.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="View obstruction">
    Generally no right to a view unless protected by easement, CC&Rs, or local ordinance. Some communities have view protection rules.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Adverse Possession

Adverse possession allows someone to gain legal ownership of land they've occupied without permission for an extended period.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Requirements">
    Possession must be:

    - **Actual:** Physical use of the land
    - **Open and notorious:** Visible, not hidden
    - **Exclusive:** Not shared with true owner
    - **Hostile:** Without owner's permission
    - **Continuous:** Uninterrupted for statutory period

    Time period varies by state (5-20 years typically).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Common scenarios">
    - Fence built on wrong side of property line for decades
    - Neighbor maintains and uses strip of land for years
    - Driveway crosses onto adjacent property long-term
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preventing adverse possession">
    - Know your boundaries (get survey)
    - Inspect property regularly
    - Address encroachments promptly
    - Grant written permission (defeats "hostile" requirement)
    - Post "no trespassing" signs
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Neighbor Nuisances

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What constitutes nuisance">
    Unreasonable interference with use and enjoyment of property:

    - Excessive noise
    - Odors
    - Light pollution
    - Smoke or dust
    - Drainage problems caused by neighbor
    - Dangerous conditions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Private vs public nuisance">
    **Private nuisance:** Affects specific neighboring properties. Individual property owner brings claim.

    **Public nuisance:** Affects community at large. Government typically addresses.
  </Accordion>

    - Communicate with neighbor directly
    - Contact HOA if applicable

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Dispute Resolution Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Direct negotiation">
    Talk to neighbor first. Many disputes result from misunderstanding. Written agreement can formalize resolution.

    Best for: Minor issues, good neighbor relationships, simple solutions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mediation">
    Neutral third party helps reach agreement. Non-binding unless parties sign settlement.

    Many communities offer low-cost neighbor mediation. Less adversarial than court.

    Best for: Moderate disputes, ongoing neighbor relationships, both parties willing to compromise.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="HOA involvement">
    If both properties in same HOA, association may address certain disputes (noise, appearance, rule violations).

    Limited to matters covered by CC&Rs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Code enforcement">
    Report violations of local ordinances (noise, property maintenance, zoning) to city or county.

    Government investigates and may cite violator. Does not resolve private disputes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lawsuit">
    Court action for boundary disputes, easements, nuisance, or trespass.

    Options include quiet title action, injunction, or damages.

    Expensive and time-consuming. May permanently damage neighbor relations. Use as last resort.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Protecting Your Interests

<Tip>
  **Preventing disputes:**

</Tip>

## Impact on Property Sales

Unresolved disputes can complicate sales:

- Survey revealing encroachments can delay closing
- Ongoing litigation must be disclosed

Resolve disputes before listing when possible. Disclose known issues honestly.
