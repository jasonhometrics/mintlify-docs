## Structuring and Protecting Your Investment

How you hold title to investment property affects liability protection, tax treatment, and operational flexibility. Legal structure decisions made early are easier than restructuring later.

Most investors also need to understand landlord-tenant law, lease agreements, and their rights and responsibilities as property owners. Legal missteps create liability and financial loss.

## Entity Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Personal ownership (sole proprietorship)">
    Holding property in your personal name with no separate entity.

    **Advantages:**

    - Simplest structure
    - No formation costs or ongoing filings
    - Easier financing (conventional loans)
    - No separate tax returns

    **Disadvantages:**

    - No liability protection
    - Personal assets at risk from lawsuits
    - All properties under same liability umbrella
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limited Liability Company (LLC)">
    A legal entity that separates business assets and liabilities from personal assets.

    **Advantages:**

    - Flexible management structure
    - Professional appearance

    **Disadvantages:**

    - Lower cost than multiple separate LLCs
    - Liability isolation between properties
    - Single annual filing

    **Disadvantages:**

    - Not available in all states
    - Recognition across state lines uncertain
    - Relatively new structure with less legal precedent
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limited Partnership (LP)">

    A corporation that elects pass-through tax treatment.

    **Advantages:**

    - Liability protection
    - Potential self-employment tax savings
    - Pass-through taxation

    **Disadvantages:**

    - More complex than LLC
    - Restrictions on ownership (100 shareholders max, no foreign owners)

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Land trust">
    A trust that holds title to real estate, with a trustee managing on behalf of beneficiaries.

    **Advantages:**

    - Privacy (owner name not in public records)
    - Easier transfer of beneficial interest
    - Can be combined with LLC as beneficiary

    **Disadvantages:**

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## LLC Basics

LLCs are the most common entity choice for real estate investors. Understanding the fundamentals helps determine if an LLC fits your situation.

### Formation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a state">
    Most investors form LLCs in the state where the property is located. Forming in a different state (like Delaware or Wyoming) requires registering as a foreign LLC in the property's state anyway, adding cost and complexity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a name">
    The name must be unique in your state and typically must include "LLC" or "Limited Liability Company."
  </Step>
  <Step title="File articles of organization">
    Submit formation documents to the state, usually the Secretary of State office. Filing fees range from $50 to $500 depending on the state.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an operating agreement">
    This internal document outlines ownership, management, profit distribution, and procedures. Required in some states, recommended in all.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain an EIN">
    Apply for an Employer Identification Number from the IRS. Free and required for business bank accounts and tax filing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open a business bank account">
    Maintain separate finances for the LLC. Commingling personal and business funds can pierce the liability protection.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Maintaining LLC Protection

Creating an LLC is not enough. Improper operation can eliminate liability protection through "piercing the corporate veil."

**Requirements to maintain protection:**

- Keep business and personal finances completely separate
- Use the LLC name on all contracts, leases, and correspondence
- Maintain adequate insurance
- Follow operating agreement procedures
- Keep proper records
- File required annual reports and pay fees
- Adequately capitalize the LLC

<Warning>
  Courts may disregard LLC protection if the entity is treated as an alter ego of the owner rather than a separate business.
</Warning>

## When to Use an LLC

| Situation                                        | Recommendation                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| First rental property, conventional financing    | Personal name may be simpler; add LLC later |
| Multiple properties                              | Consider LLC for liability isolation        |
| High personal net worth                          | LLC protection more valuable                |
| Partners or investors involved                   | LLC provides clear structure                |
| Higher-risk properties (multifamily, commercial) | LLC recommended                             |
| Properties with significant equity               | Protect built-up equity with LLC            |

<Note>
  Some investors hold properties in personal name for financing purposes, then transfer to an LLC after closing. This may trigger due-on-sale clauses in mortgages, though lenders rarely enforce them for transfers to single-member LLCs. Consult with an attorney before transferring.
</Note>

## Landlord Responsibilities

Property owners have legal obligations to tenants regardless of entity structure.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Habitability">

    State laws govern:

    - Maximum deposit amounts
    - Where deposits must be held

    - Lead paint hazards (pre-1978 properties)
    - Known material defects
    - Registered sex offenders (some states)

    Landlords have the right to collect rent as specified in the lease and pursue legal remedies for non-payment, including late fees, notices, and eviction.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Screen tenants">
    Landlords can screen applicants using consistent, non-discriminatory criteria including credit checks, background checks, income verification, and rental history.

  <Accordion title="Enforce lease terms">
    Landlords can enforce lease provisions regarding pets, occupancy limits, noise, property care, and other rules. Violations can lead to notices and eviction.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enter the property">
    With proper notice, landlords can enter for inspections, repairs, showings (near lease end), and other legitimate purposes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Evict for cause">

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not renew lease">
    In most jurisdictions, landlords can choose not to renew a lease at term end without cause (rent control areas may have restrictions).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Lease Agreements

The lease is the foundational legal document governing the landlord-tenant relationship.

**Essential lease provisions:**

| Provision            | Purpose                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Parties and property | Identifies who is bound and what property is covered |
| Term                 | Start date, end date, renewal terms                  |
| Rent                 | Amount, due date, payment methods, late fees         |
| Security deposit     | Amount, conditions for deductions, return timeline   |
| Utilities            | Who pays for which utilities                         |

| Entry                | Notice requirements and permitted purposes           |
| Termination          | How lease can be ended, notice requirements          |
| Default and remedies | What happens if either party breaches                |

<Note>
  Use state-specific lease forms or have an attorney review your lease. Provisions that violate state law may be unenforceable and create liability.
</Note>

## Eviction Process

When tenants violate the lease or fail to pay rent, landlords must follow legal eviction procedures.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Document the violation">
    Keep records of non-payment, lease violations, or other issues. Documentation supports your case if contested.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Serve proper notice">
    State law specifies required notices (pay or quit, cure or quit, unconditional quit) and delivery methods. Improper notice can delay or derail eviction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="File eviction lawsuit">
    If the tenant does not comply with the notice, file an unlawful detainer or eviction action with the court.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attend court hearing">
    Present your case with documentation. The tenant can contest. The judge rules on whether eviction is granted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain judgment and writ">
    If successful, obtain a judgment and writ of possession authorizing removal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sheriff executes removal">
    Only law enforcement can physically remove a tenant. Self-help evictions (changing locks, removing belongings) are illegal and create liability.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Never attempt self-help eviction. Changing locks, shutting off utilities, or removing tenant belongings without court order is illegal in all states and can result in significant liability.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Consult a real estate attorney before forming entities or drafting leases. State laws vary significantly, and mistakes create liability that exceeds the cost of professional guidance.
