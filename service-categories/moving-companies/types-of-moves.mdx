Moving services are categorized by distance, complexity, and special requirements. The type of move affects pricing structure, regulation, timeline, and which companies can perform the service.

Understanding move types helps consumers find appropriate providers and set accurate expectations.

## Local Moves

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Definition">
    Moves within the same metropolitan area, typically under 50 miles. Sometimes defined as moves within the same state.

    Also called intrastate moves when staying within state boundaries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How they're priced">
    Local moves are typically charged by:

    - **Hourly rate:** \$25 - \$75 per mover per hour (\$100 - \$200+ total crew rate)
    - **Truck fee:** Flat charge for vehicle (often included in hourly)
    - **Travel time:** Portal-to-portal or job-site only
    - **Minimum hours:** Usually 2-3 hour minimum

    **Example:** 3 movers at \$45/hour each plus \$75 truck fee. \$4-hour move = \$615.

    High-cost markets may see significantly higher rates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Typical timeline">
    Same-day completion for most local moves:

    - Small apartment: 2 to 4 hours
    - Average home: 4 to 8 hours
    - Large home: 8 to 12 hours

    Loading, transport, and unloading happen consecutively.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regulation">
    Regulated at state level, if at all.

    - Some states require mover licensing
    - Some states have no requirements
    - Insurance requirements vary
    - Less federal oversight than interstate

    Check your state's specific requirements.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Long-Distance Moves

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Definition">
    Moves exceeding 50-100 miles, depending on company definition. May be intrastate (within state) or interstate (crossing state lines).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How they're priced">
    Long-distance moves typically charged by:

    - **Weight:** Cost per pound (often per 100 pounds/CWT)
    - **Distance:** Mileage from origin to destination
    - **Services:** Packing, unpacking, special handling

    Estimates based on inventory list or in-home survey.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Typical timeline">
    Multi-day process:

    - **Loading:** Day 1
    - **Transit:** 1 to 14+ days depending on distance
    - **Delivery:** Scheduled window (often 1-3 day range)

    Direct delivery is faster but more expensive. Consolidated shipments take longer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Delivery spreads">
    Long-distance moves often have delivery windows rather than specific dates:

    - Short distance (under 500 miles): 1 to 3 days
    - Medium distance (500-1,500 miles): 3 to 7 days
    - Long distance (1,500+ miles): 7 to 14 days
    - Cross-country: Up to 21 days

    Tighter windows may cost more.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Interstate Moves

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Definition">
    Any move crossing state lines. Subject to federal regulation regardless of distance.

    Moving from one state to a neighboring state 20 miles away is interstate and federally regulated.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Federal requirements">
    FMCSA regulates interstate movers:

    - Must have USDOT number
    - Must have MC (Motor Carrier) number
    - Must carry minimum insurance
    - Must provide written estimate
    - Must provide "Your Rights and Responsibilities" booklet
    - Must offer valuation options
    - Must have dispute resolution process
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verifying licensing">
    Before hiring an interstate mover:

    1. Get company's USDOT number
    2. Search FMCSA database (safer.fmcsa.dot.gov)
    3. Verify operating authority is active
    4. Check insurance status
    5. Review complaint history

    Never hire an interstate mover without valid USDOT and MC numbers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consumer protections">
    Federal rules provide protections:

    - Binding estimates cannot increase except for added services you request
    - Non-binding estimates cannot exceed 110% of estimate at delivery
    - Must deliver on agreed date or within spread
    - Cannot hold shipment hostage for more than 110% of estimate
    - 9-month window to file claims
    - Arbitration available for disputes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Interstate moves have more consumer protections than local moves due to federal regulation. Always verify USDOT and MC numbers before hiring a company for any move crossing state lines.
