title: "Insurance & Moving In"
description: "Protecting your investment and getting settled in your new home"
---

Before closing, your lender requires proof of homeowners insurance. After closing, you need to move in. Both steps are often treated as afterthoughts, leading to rushed decisions and unnecessary costs. Starting early gives you time to compare options and avoid last-minute mistakes.

## Homeowners Insurance

Homeowners insurance protects your property and belongings from damage, plus provides liability coverage if someone is injured on your property. Your lender requires proof of coverage before they'll fund your loan.

### Why It Matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Lender requirement">
    The property is collateral for your loan. If it's destroyed and you can't rebuild, the lender loses their security. Insurance ensures the property can be repaired or rebuilt, protecting both you and the lender.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Financial protection">
    Without insurance, you're personally responsible for repair or replacement costs after fire, storm damage, theft, or other covered events. A major loss without coverage could mean financial ruin.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Liability coverage">
    If someone is injured on your property and sues, liability coverage pays for legal defense and damages. Without it, your personal assets are at risk.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### When to Start

Start researching insurance 30-45 days before closing. This gives you time to:

- Get quotes from multiple providers
- Understand coverage options and exclusions
- Compare policies beyond just price
- Avoid accepting whatever quote you can get at the last minute

<Warning>
  Most buyers treat insurance as a last-minute checkbox. A week before closing, the lender asks for proof of coverage. Buyers panic, call the first company they find, and accept whatever quote they're given. This leads to overpaying for policies that don't actually cover what they need.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  You have the right to choose your own insurance provider. [RESPA](/service-categories/legal/consumer-protections/respa) prohibits lenders from requiring a specific company. Shop around even if your lender or agent makes a recommendation.
</Tip>

### What Policies Cover

Standard homeowners insurance covers your dwelling, personal property, liability, and additional living expenses if your home is uninhabitable. But coverage has limits and exclusions.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Dwelling coverage">
    Pays to repair or rebuild your home's structure after covered damage. Coverage should equal the cost to rebuild your home, not the purchase price or market value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personal property">
    Covers belongings inside your home: furniture, clothing, electronics, appliances. Standard policies have limits on high-value items like jewelry, art, and collectibles.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Liability">
    Covers legal defense and damages if someone is injured on your property or you accidentally damage someone else's property. Standard coverage is often \$100,000 - \$300,000.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Additional living expenses">
    Pays for temporary housing, food, and other costs if your home is uninhabitable after a covered loss.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What's Typically NOT Covered

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Flooding">
    Standard homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage. Separate [flood insurance](/service-categories/homeowners-insurance/flood-insurance) is required, even if you're not in a designated flood zone. If you're in a high-risk area with a federally-backed mortgage, flood insurance is mandatory.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Earthquakes">
    Not covered by standard policies. Separate [earthquake coverage](/service-categories/homeowners-insurance/specialty-coverage) is available in affected regions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Maintenance issues">
    Gradual damage from lack of maintenance, mold, pest infestations, and normal wear and tear are not covered.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sewer backup">
    Often excluded from standard policies. Can be added as an endorsement for additional premium.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Replacement Cost vs Actual Cash Value

This distinction determines how much you receive after a claim.

|                | Replacement Cost         | Actual Cash Value                |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Pays**       | Cost to replace with new | Current value minus depreciation |
| **Example**    | \$1,500 for new TV       | \$400 for 5-year-old TV          |
| **Premium**    | Higher                   | Lower                            |
| **Protection** | Better                   | Less                             |

Replacement cost policies cost more but provide significantly better protection when you need to make a claim.

### What Affects Premiums

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Location">
    Proximity to fire stations, flood zones, crime rates, and regional weather patterns all affect rates. You can't change location, but you should understand how it impacts your premium.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Home characteristics">
    Age, construction type, roof condition, square footage, and building materials affect risk assessment. Older roofs and outdated electrical or plumbing may increase premiums.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Coverage amounts">
    Higher dwelling coverage, lower deductibles, and additional endorsements increase premiums. Balance adequate coverage against affordability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Claims history">
    Your personal claims history and the property's claims history affect rates. Multiple recent claims typically increase premiums.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deductible">
    Higher deductibles lower premiums. Choose a deductible you can afford to pay out of pocket if you need to file a claim.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Discounts">
    Bundling with auto insurance, security systems, smoke detectors, new roof, and claims-free history can reduce premiums. Ask about all available discounts.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Comparing Insurance Providers

Get quotes from at least three providers. Compare more than just price.

**What to evaluate:**

- Coverage limits and deductibles
- What's included vs what requires endorsements
- Claims process and reputation
- Financial stability ratings
- Customer service responsiveness
- Discounts available

**Questions to ask:**

- What's covered and what's excluded?
- Is this replacement cost or actual cash value?
- What's the [claims process](/service-categories/homeowners-insurance/filing-claims)?
- How long have you been in business?
- What discounts am I eligible for?
- Do I need separate flood insurance for this property?

## Moving Companies

After closing, you need to move your belongings to your new home. Moving companies range from excellent to fraudulent. Research protects you from scams and ensures your belongings arrive safely.

### Types of Moves

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local moves">
    Within the same metropolitan area or under 50-100 miles. Typically charged by the hour plus materials. Less regulated than interstate moves.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Long-distance moves">
    Interstate or over 100 miles. Charged by weight and distance. Interstate movers must be registered with FMCSA and have a USDOT number.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Full-service moves">
    Company handles everything: packing, loading, transport, unloading, unpacking. Most expensive but least effort.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Self-service moves">
    You pack and load, company transports. Middle ground on cost and effort.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DIY moves">
    Rent a truck and do everything yourself. Least expensive but most work. Best for local moves with help available.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Getting Estimates

Get estimates from at least three companies. Be wary of estimates that seem too good to be true.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="In-home estimates">
    A representative visits your home to assess belongings. Most accurate for larger moves. Required for binding estimates on interstate moves.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Virtual estimates">
    Video call walkthrough of your home. More convenient than in-home but still reasonably accurate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Phone/online estimates">
    Based only on what you describe. Least accurate. Often used by scammers to lowball initial quotes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Types of estimates:**

| Type                      | What It Means                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Binding**               | Price is guaranteed regardless of actual weight             |
| **Non-binding**           | Final price based on actual weight; can increase            |
| **Binding not-to-exceed** | Price won't exceed estimate; may be lower if weight is less |

<Note>
  For interstate moves, federal law requires movers to offer both binding and non-binding estimates. Binding not-to-exceed offers the most protection.
</Note>

### Avoiding Moving Scams

Moving scams are common. Fraudulent companies provide low estimates, then hold belongings hostage for inflated prices or disappear entirely.

**Red flags:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No in-person or video estimate">
    Legitimate companies need to see what you're moving to provide accurate quotes. Phone-only estimates allow scammers to lowball then inflate later.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Large deposit required">
    Reputable movers typically don't require large upfront deposits. Scammers collect deposits then disappear or use them as leverage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No physical address">
    Legitimate moving companies have physical locations. Scammers operate from untraceable addresses or PO boxes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Generic truck and no uniforms">
    Professional movers have branded trucks and uniformed crews. Unmarked trucks and casual dress can indicate illegitimate operations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cash-only payment">
    Legitimate companies accept multiple payment methods. Cash-only requests eliminate your recourse if something goes wrong.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No USDOT number">
    Interstate movers must be registered with FMCSA. Verify their USDOT number at fmcsa.dot.gov. No number means they're not legally operating.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Dramatically lower estimate">
    If one estimate is significantly lower than others, be suspicious. Scammers use low quotes to win business then inflate on moving day.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Never sign a blank contract. Never pay a large deposit before moving day. Never hire a company that won't provide a written estimate and contract.
</Warning>

### Protecting Your Belongings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Valuation coverage">
    Moving companies offer two levels of [liability protection](/service-categories/moving-companies/protecting-your-belongings):

    - **Released value:** Free but minimal. Pays only \$0.60 per pound per item. A 50-pound TV worth \$1,500 gets you \$30.
    - **Full value protection:** Costs extra. Company must repair, replace, or pay current market value for damaged items.

    Full value protection is worth the additional cost for valuable belongings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document condition">
    Photograph valuable items before the move. Document existing damage. Keep an inventory list. This supports claims if items are damaged or missing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Move valuables yourself">
    Transport jewelry, important documents, medications, and irreplaceable items in your own vehicle. Don't trust them to the moving truck.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inspect before signing">
    Before signing delivery paperwork, inspect your belongings. Note any damage on the delivery receipt. Once you sign without noting damage, claims become difficult.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Timing Your Move

Coordinate your move with your closing date. Remember that you don't own the property until closing is complete and recorded.

**Considerations:**

- Don't schedule movers for closing day itself (closings can be delayed)
- Confirm possession terms in your contract (same day? next day?)
- Have a backup plan if closing is delayed
- Book movers well in advance, especially during peak season (summer months, end of month)
