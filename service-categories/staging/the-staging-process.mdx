title: "The Staging Process"
description: "What happens from consultation to installation"
---

Home staging follows a structured process from initial consultation through installation and eventual removal. Understanding the timeline and steps helps sellers prepare and set realistic expectations.

The process varies somewhat by staging type (vacant vs occupied) and provider.

## Initial Consultation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens">
    The stager visits the property to assess its condition and potential:
    
    - Walk through all rooms
    - Discuss seller goals and timeline
    - Note architectural features to highlight
    - Identify problem areas to address
    - Discuss budget parameters
    - Take photos and measurements
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What to prepare">
    Before the consultation:
    
    - Have listing agent present if possible
    - Know your budget range
    - Know your timeline for listing
    - Be prepared to discuss target buyer
    - Have questions ready
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Consultation outcomes">
    After the consultation, expect:
    
    - Recommended staging approach
    - Scope of work proposal
    - Cost estimate or quote
    - Timeline for completion
    - List of pre-staging tasks for seller
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pre-Staging Preparation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Seller responsibilities">
    Before staging installation, sellers typically need to:
    
    - Declutter all rooms
    - Remove personal items and photos
    - Complete any repairs
    - Deep clean the property
    - Touch up paint as needed
    - Address landscaping and curb appeal
    
    Stagers provide specific guidance on what needs to be done.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Decluttering guidance">
    Effective decluttering includes:
    
    - Remove 30-50% of belongings
    - Clear countertops and surfaces
    - Organize closets (buyers look inside)
    - Remove excess furniture
    - Pack away collections and personal items
    - Clear garage and storage areas
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why preparation matters">
    Staging cannot hide clutter, dirt, or disrepair. The property must be clean and decluttered before staging can be effective.
    
    Skipping preparation wastes staging investment and undermines results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Staging Plan Development

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Design planning">
    The stager develops a plan for each room:
    
    - Furniture layout and selection
    - Color palette and style direction
    - Artwork and accessory placement
    - Lighting considerations
    - Flow between rooms
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Furniture sourcing">
    For vacant staging, the stager sources furniture:
    
    - From their own inventory
    - From furniture rental companies
    - Combination of owned and rented pieces
    
    Sourcing takes time, especially for specific styles or larger homes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Timeline">
    Plan development and sourcing typically takes 1-2 weeks after consultation. Rush timelines may be possible for additional fees.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Installation Day

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens">
    On installation day:
    
    - Furniture delivered and placed
    - Artwork hung
    - Accessories arranged
    - Beds made with staging linens
    - Final styling and adjustments
    - Walk-through with seller/agent
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Timeline">
    Installation typically takes:
    
    - Small home (1-2 bedrooms): 2-4 hours
    - Medium home (3-4 bedrooms): 4-6 hours
    - Large home (5+ bedrooms): Full day or multiple days
    
    Complex installations or large luxury homes may require additional time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Seller involvement">
    Sellers should:
    
    - Ensure property is fully prepared
    - Be available for questions
    - Review completed staging
    - Understand care instructions
    
    Sellers typically do not need to be present for entire installation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## During the Listing Period

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Maintaining staging">
    While the home is listed:
    
    - Keep staged areas clean and tidy
    - Don't rearrange furniture
    - Replace wilted plants
    - Maintain bedding and pillows
    - Keep surfaces clear
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Living in a staged home">
    If occupied during staging:
    
    - Follow stager's guidelines
    - Store daily-use items out of sight
    - Restore staging before each showing
    - Avoid using staged guest rooms
    
    Living in a staged home requires discipline but is manageable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rental period">
    Furniture rentals are typically contracted for:
    
    - 30 days minimum (most common)
    - 60 or 90 day terms
    - Month-to-month extensions if needed
    
    Understand rental terms before staging begins.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Removal and Wrap-Up

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When removal happens">
    Staging is typically removed:
    
    - After closing
    - After buyer's final walk-through
    - At end of rental period if unsold
    
    Coordinate timing with your real estate agent.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Removal process">
    The stager handles:
    
    - All furniture removal
    - Artwork and accessory pickup
    - Property left clean and empty
    
    Removal typically takes same time as installation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="If home doesn't sell">
    If the property doesn't sell within the rental period:
    
    - Extend rental agreement
    - Convert to partial staging
    - Remove staging and relist
    - Adjust price and marketing strategy
    
    Discuss contingency plans with stager upfront.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Virtual Staging Process

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How it differs">
    Virtual staging follows a simpler process:
    
    1. Property photographed empty
    2. Photos sent to virtual staging company
    3. Style preferences communicated
    4. Digitally staged images returned (24-48 hours typical)
    5. Images used in listing
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Photo requirements">
    For best virtual staging results:
    
    - High-resolution photos
    - Good lighting
    - Straight angles
    - Empty, clean rooms
    - No wide-angle distortion
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Disclosure requirements">
    Virtually staged photos must be disclosed in listings. Buyers should know that the furniture shown is not physically present.
    
    Failure to disclose virtual staging is misleading and potentially problematic.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Working with Your Stager

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Communication">
    Maintain clear communication about:
    
    - Timeline changes
    - Showing schedules
    - Any damage to staged items
    - Questions or concerns
    - Offer status
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Trust the process">
    Stagers are professionals who understand buyer psychology. Their recommendations may differ from your personal taste.
    
    Staging is about appealing to buyers, not reflecting owner preferences.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Coordinate with agent">
    Your real estate agent and stager should work together:
    
    - Agent provides market insights
    - Stager provides design expertise
    - Both focused on selling your home
    
    Ensure they communicate with each other.
