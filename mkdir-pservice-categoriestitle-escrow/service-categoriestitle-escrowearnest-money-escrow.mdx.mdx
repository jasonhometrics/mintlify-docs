# Earnest Money & Escrow

<Note>
Earnest money shows you're serious about buying. It's held in escrow (neutral third-party account) until closing, then applied to your down payment or refunded if the deal falls through under valid contingencies.
</Note>

## How Much You'll Pay

**Typical earnest money deposit: 1-3% of purchase price**

**Examples:**
- $300,000 home = $3,000-$9,000 deposit
- $500,000 home = $5,000-$15,000 deposit

**In competitive markets:** Buyers sometimes offer higher earnest money (5-10%) to show they're serious. This strengthens your offer but increases your financial risk if the deal falls through.

<Tip>
Your offer should specify exact dollar amount, not percentage. This avoids confusion if purchase price changes during negotiations.
</Tip>

## Where It Goes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Day 1-3: You Wire Funds">
    Within 3 business days of offer acceptance, you wire earnest money to title company's escrow account.
    
    **Critical:** Verify wiring instructions by phone. This is the #1 target for wire fraud.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Held in Escrow">
    Funds sit in title company's trust account—separate from their operating account. They cannot touch this money; it's legally held for your benefit until closing conditions are met.
    
    Some title companies pay interest on escrow funds (rare, but ask).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Applied at Closing">
    **If deal closes:** Earnest money is credited toward your down payment or closing costs. You don't bring this money again—it's already held on your behalf.
    
    **If deal falls through:** Refunded or forfeited depending on circumstances (see below).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When You Get It Back

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Valid Contingency Not Met">
    **You get 100% refund if:**
    
    ✓ Financing contingency: Lender denies your loan through no fault of yours
    
    ✓ Inspection contingency: Inspection reveals major issues and seller won't make agreed repairs
    
    ✓ Appraisal contingency: Appraisal comes in low and seller won't reduce price
    
    ✓ Sale of current home contingency: Your home doesn't sell by deadline
    
    ✓ Title contingency: Title defects can't be resolved
    
    **Timeline:** 3-10 business days after written notice to title company
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Mutual Agreement to Cancel">
    If both parties agree in writing to cancel the contract (regardless of reason), earnest money is refunded.
    
    This sometimes happens when:
    - Seller can't deliver property as promised
    - Buyer and seller can't agree on repairs after inspection
    - Unexpected issues make deal unworkable for both parties
    
    **Timeline:** 3-10 business days after signed cancellation agreement
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Seller Breaches Contract">
    If seller backs out without valid reason (gets higher offer, changes mind, etc.), you get your earnest money back plus potentially can sue for damages.
    
    **Timeline:** Varies depending on circumstances and whether litigation is involved
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## When You Lose It

<Warning>
You forfeit earnest money if you back out without valid reason after contingency deadlines pass.
</Warning>

**Common scenarios where you lose your deposit:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="You Get Cold Feet" icon="door-open">
    Contingencies have passed or you waived them. Inspection is fine, financing approved, but you decide you don't want the house anymore.
    
    **Result:** Seller keeps your earnest money as compensation for taking property off market.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="You Miss Deadlines" icon="clock">
    You had inspection contingency but didn't complete inspection by deadline. Or you missed financing contingency deadline and now lender denies loan.
    
    **Result:** Once deadlines pass, you can't back out using that contingency. You're in breach if you walk away.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="You Fail to Perform" icon="xmark">
    Financing falls through because you made major purchase (new car) after getting pre-approved, changed jobs, or otherwise violated loan terms.
    
    **Result:** This is your fault, not a valid financing contingency. Seller keeps deposit.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="You Don't Show Up to Closing" icon="calendar-xmark">
    Everything is ready, title is clear, financing approved—but you don't attend closing or refuse to sign.
    
    **Result:** Seller keeps deposit and may sue for additional damages (lost sale price if market drops).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How It's Protected

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Escrow Account Separation" icon="building-columns">
    Your earnest money sits in title company's trust account, legally separate from their operating funds. They can't use it to pay their bills or run their business.
    
    Even if title company goes bankrupt, your escrow funds are protected.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="State Regulations" icon="gavel">
    Most states require title companies to maintain errors & omissions insurance and be licensed/bonded. This protects you if they mishandle your deposit.
    
    Check your state's title insurance regulations for specific protections.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Written Accounting" icon="file-invoice-dollar">
    Title company must provide accounting showing:
    - When they received your deposit
    - Where it's held
    - Interest earned (if applicable)
    - How it will be applied at closing
    
    Request this before closing to verify everything is correct.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Contract Language" icon="file-contract">
    Your purchase contract specifies:
    - Exact earnest money amount
    - Deadline to deliver funds
    - Which title company holds it
    - Conditions for refund or forfeiture
    
    Read this section carefully before signing.

## Disputes Over Earnest Money

**What happens if you and seller disagree about who gets the deposit?**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Title Company Freezes Funds">
    Once there's a dispute, title company won't release funds to either party without:
    - Written agreement from both parties, OR
    - Court order
    
    They're legally prohibited from taking sides.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Mediation or Arbitration">
    Your contract may require mediation or arbitration before litigation. This is faster and cheaper than court.
    
    Neutral third party reviews evidence and makes binding decision.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Litigation">
    If mediation fails, you or seller file lawsuit. Court decides who gets the deposit.
    
    **Cost:** Legal fees often exceed earnest money amount, so this is last resort.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Settlement">
    Most disputes settle: split the deposit, buyer gets 75%, seller gets 25%, etc.
    
    Settlement happens when both sides realize litigation costs more than compromise.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
To avoid disputes: document everything. If you're backing out under contingency, provide written notice to seller and title company citing specific contract language. Don't just stop responding to emails.
</Tip>

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I increase my earnest money after offer is accepted to strengthen my position?**

A: Yes, if both parties agree in writing. Sometimes buyers do this if competing offers emerge or if they want to remove a contingency.

**Q: What if I need my earnest money back urgently but title company is slow to process?**

A: Title companies typically take 3-10 business days to cut refund checks. If you need it faster, escalate to their manager and explain urgency. Most will expedite if pushed.

**Q: Can seller keep my deposit if appraisal comes in low?**

A: Not if you have appraisal contingency. You can walk away and get full refund. But if you waived this contingency, you're committed regardless of appraisal.

**Q: What happens to earnest money if closing is delayed?**

A: It stays in escrow. As long as delay isn't due to buyer breach, you don't lose it. If delay is seller's fault, you can sometimes demand return of deposit and walk away.
