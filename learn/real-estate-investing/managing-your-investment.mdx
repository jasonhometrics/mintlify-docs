## Operating Your Rental Property

Property management encompasses everything required to maintain the property, keep it occupied, and collect rent. Investors choose between handling these tasks themselves or hiring [professional management](/service-categories/property-management/overview).

The right approach depends on the investor's time, proximity to the property, number of units, and willingness to handle landlord responsibilities directly.

## Cost of Property Management

Professional management fees reduce cash flow but provide time savings and expertise.

| Fee Type              | Typical Range                 | Notes                                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Monthly management    | 8-12% of collected rent       | Core ongoing fee                       |
| Leasing fee           | 50-100% of first month's rent | Charged when placing new tenant        |
| Lease renewal fee     | \$100-300 or percentage       | Some managers charge, others include   |
| Maintenance markup    | 10-20%                        | Added to vendor invoices               |
| Eviction coordination | \$200-500+                    | Plus legal costs                       |
| Vacancy fee           | Varies                        | Some charge reduced fee during vacancy |

<Note>
  Fee structures vary significantly. Compare [total costs across managers](/service-categories/property-management/costs-and-fees), not just the headline management percentage.
</Note>

## Evaluating Property Managers

Not all property managers deliver the same service quality. [Evaluate carefully](/service-categories/property-management/comparing-property-managers) before hiring.

**Questions to ask:**

- How many units do you manage?
- What is your vacancy rate across your portfolio?
- How do you handle maintenance requests?
- What is your tenant screening process?
- How do you handle evictions?
- What reports will I receive and how often?
- What is your fee structure including all fees?
- Can I speak with current clients as references?
- What is your communication style and response time?

<Warning>
**Red flags when evaluating property managers:**
- Unwilling to provide references
- Unclear or complicated fee structure
- High portfolio vacancy rates
- Poor online reviews from tenants or owners
- Slow response during your evaluation process
- No written management agreement
</Warning>

## Tenant Screening

Selecting reliable tenants is the most important factor in successful property management. Consistent, thorough screening reduces late payments, evictions, and property damage.

### Screening Criteria

Establish written criteria applied consistently to all applicants to ensure [fair housing](/service-categories/legal/consumer-protections/fair-housing) compliance.

| Criterion        | Common Standard             | Purpose                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Income           | 2.5-3x monthly rent         | Ability to pay            |
| Credit score     | 620-680 minimum             | Payment history indicator |
| Rental history   | 2+ years positive history   | Past landlord behavior    |
| Background check | No recent evictions         | Risk indicator            |
| Employment       | Verified current employment | Income stability          |

<Warning>
  Apply screening criteria consistently to all applicants. Inconsistent application creates fair housing liability.
</Warning>

### Screening Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-screening">
    Before showing the property, verify basic qualifications: income range, move-in timeline, reason for moving, pets, number of occupants. This saves time showing to unqualified applicants.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Application">
    Collect a written application with authorization to verify information and run credit and background checks. Charge an application fee to cover costs (where permitted by law).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Credit check">
    Review credit report for payment history, outstanding collections, and overall score. Look for patterns rather than isolated issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Background check">
    Check for eviction history and criminal background. Follow fair housing guidelines regarding how criminal history is considered.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Income verification">
    Verify income through pay stubs, tax returns, or employer contact. Self-employed applicants may require additional documentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rental history verification">
    Contact previous landlords to verify payment history, lease compliance, and whether they would rent to the applicant again.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decision">
    Approve, deny, or approve with conditions (such as additional deposit where permitted). Provide adverse action notice if denying based on credit report.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Screening Services

Several services provide tenant screening for landlords:

- TransUnion SmartMove
- RentPrep
- Experian Connect
- MyRental
- Avail (for smaller landlords)

Costs typically range from \$25-50 per applicant, often paid by the applicant as part of the application fee.

## Rent Collection

Consistent rent collection maintains cash flow and establishes expectations.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Payment methods">
    Offer convenient payment options:

    - Online payment portals (most efficient)
    - ACH bank transfers
    - Check or money order
    - Payment apps (Venmo, Zelle)

    Avoid cash payments when possible due to documentation and safety concerns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Due dates and grace periods">
    Most leases specify rent due on the 1st with a grace period (often 3-5 days) before late fees apply. Be consistent in applying the [lease](/service-categories/legal/rentals/lease-agreements) terms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Late fees">
    Charge late fees as specified in the lease. State laws may limit late fee amounts. Consistent enforcement encourages on-time payment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Non-payment response">
    When rent is not paid:

    1. Contact tenant to understand situation
    2. Serve pay or quit notice per state law
    3. Offer payment plan if appropriate
    4. Begin [eviction process](/service-categories/legal/rentals/eviction-process) if not resolved

    Document all communications and actions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Maintenance Management

Responsive maintenance protects property value and tenant satisfaction.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Establishing vendor relationships">
    Build a network of reliable contractors before emergencies:

    - General handyman for small repairs
    - Plumber for water issues
    - Electrician for electrical problems
    - HVAC technician for heating and cooling
    - Appliance repair technician

    Get multiple quotes initially to establish fair pricing benchmarks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Response time expectations">
    Set clear expectations for response times:

    - **Emergencies** (flooding, no heat, gas leak): Same day
    - **Urgent** (broken appliance, plumbing issue): 24-48 hours
    - **Routine** (cosmetic issues, minor repairs): Within one week
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Maintenance reserves">
    Set aside funds for ongoing repairs and major replacements. Common rules of thumb:

    - 5-10% of rent for routine maintenance
    - Additional reserves for capital expenditures (roof, HVAC)
    - Older properties need higher reserves
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preventive maintenance">
    Scheduled maintenance reduces emergency repairs:

    - HVAC filter changes (quarterly)
    - Gutter cleaning (seasonally)
    - Smoke/CO detector testing (annually)
    - Water heater flushing (annually)
    - Exterior inspection (annually)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Property Inspections

Regular inspections catch problems early and verify lease compliance.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Move-in inspection">
    Document property condition thoroughly before tenant occupies. Take photos or video of every room, noting existing damage or wear. Both parties should sign the inspection report.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Periodic inspections">
    Conduct interior inspections quarterly to annually. Check for lease violations, maintenance needs, and unreported issues. Provide proper notice per state law.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Move-out inspection">

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Drive-by inspections">
    Periodically observe exterior condition without entering. Check for lease violations, unauthorized occupants, or property care issues.
  </Accordion>
