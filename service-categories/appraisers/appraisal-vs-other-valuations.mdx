Multiple methods exist for estimating property value. Each serves different purposes, has different levels of accuracy, and is appropriate for different situations.

Understanding the differences helps property owners choose the right valuation method for their needs.

## Valuation Methods Overview

    | ------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- |
    | Creator      | Agent             | Licensed appraiser    |

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  CMAs are useful tools but are not appraisals. Agents providing CMAs may benefit from higher values (higher commission) or may undervalue to get quick sale. Consider the source when evaluating.
</Note>

## Automated Valuation Model (AVM)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What it is">
    Computer-generated estimate using algorithms, public records, and market data. No human inspection or analysis.

    Examples: Zillow Zestimate, Redfin Estimate, bank AVM tools.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How it works">
    Algorithm analyzes:

    - Public records (square footage, lot size, age)
    - Recent sales in area
    - Tax assessments
    - Listing history
    - Market trends

    Generates estimated value and confidence score.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Strengths">
    - Instant results
    - Free or low cost
    - Covers most properties
    - Useful for quick estimates
    - Updates regularly
    - Consistent methodology
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limitations">
    - Cannot see inside property
    - Doesn't know about renovations
    - Misses unique features
    - Accuracy varies significantly
    - Can be wildly wrong
    - Based on potentially outdated data
    - No accountability
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Accuracy">
    Zillow reports median error of about 2-7% for on-market homes, higher for off-market.

    **What this means:**

    - Half of estimates are off by more than this amount
    - Individual property errors can be 10-20%+
    - Unique properties have higher error rates
    - Recently renovated homes often undervalued
    - Unusual markets have less accuracy
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When appropriate">
    - General ballpark estimate
    - Monitoring value over time
    - Preliminary research
    - Comparing neighborhoods

    **Not appropriate for:**

    - Setting listing price (without other data)
    - Making offers
    - Legal or lending purposes
    - Insurance coverage decisions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Online estimates (Zestimates, etc.) can be significantly wrong. They cannot see inside your home, don't know about renovations, and rely on potentially outdated public records. Use as rough guide only.
</Warning>

## Broker Price Opinion (BPO)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What it is">
    Valuation by licensed real estate broker, less detailed than appraisal. Often includes exterior inspection only.

    Used primarily by lenders for internal decisions, not for mortgage origination.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Types">
    **Drive-by BPO:** Exterior inspection only. Agent views from street.

    **Interior BPO:** Agent enters property to assess condition and features.

    **Desktop BPO:** No inspection. Based on data and photos only.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When used">
    - Short sale decisions
    - Foreclosure valuations
    - REO (bank-owned) pricing
    - Portfolio monitoring
    - HELOC reviews
    - Loss mitigation

    Not used for mortgage origination (appraisal required).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="BPO vs appraisal">
    | Factor       | BPO                 | Appraisal          |
    | ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
    | Creator      | Real estate broker  | Licensed appraiser |
    | Cost         | \$50 - \$150        | \$400 - \$600      |
    | Standards    | Varies              | USPAP              |
    | Detail       | Limited             | Comprehensive      |
    | Inspection   | Often exterior only | Full interior      |
    | Mortgage use | No                  | Yes                |
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tax Assessment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What it is">
    Government valuation for property tax purposes. Performed by county or municipal assessor.

    Not intended to reflect precise market value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How it works">
    Assessors use mass appraisal techniques:

    - Statistical models
    - Property characteristics from records
    - Sales data from the area
    - Cost data for construction

    Individual properties not inspected annually.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Relationship to market value">
    Tax assessment may equal, exceed, or fall below market value.

    **Assessment ratio:** Some jurisdictions assess at percentage of market value (e.g., 80%).

    **Timing lag:** Assessments may be based on data 1-3 years old.

    **Mass appraisal limitations:** Individual property differences may not be captured.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why it differs from appraisal">
    - Different purpose (taxation vs lending)
    - Different methodology (mass vs individual)
    - Different timing (periodic vs current)
    - Different standards
    - No interior inspection
    - May not reflect recent improvements
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using assessment for value">
    **Don't rely on tax assessment for:**

    - Listing price
    - Offer amount
    - True market value

    Assessment is one data point but should not be primary value indicator.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Choosing the Right Method

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="For selling your home">
    **Start with:** CMA from experienced local agent

    **Consider adding:** Pre-listing appraisal for pricing confidence

    **Use AVMs for:** Ballpark sanity check only
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="For buying a home">
    **Rely on:** Appraisal ordered by lender

    **Use CMA for:** Informing offer strategy

    **Use AVM for:** Quick neighborhood research
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="For refinancing">
    **Required:** Appraisal (lender orders)

    **For preliminary estimate:** AVM or agent opinion
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="For legal matters">
    **Required:** Professional appraisal

    Estate, divorce, litigation all need defensible appraisal from licensed professional.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="For property taxes">
    **To challenge assessment:** Professional appraisal showing market value is lower than assessed value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="For insurance">
    **For replacement cost:** Appraisal or insurance company's estimate

    Market value differs from replacement cost. Don't use AVM or CMA for insurance decisions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Misconceptions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tax assessment equals market value">
    False. Assessments may be higher or lower than market value and often lag current conditions by years.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Zillow Zestimate is accurate">
    Sometimes, but often not. Accuracy varies widely by property type and market. Can be off by 10-20% or more.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CMA is same as appraisal">
    No. CMAs are helpful but lack independence, standardized methodology, and legal standing of appraisals.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Higher value is always better">
    Depends on purpose. For buying, lower appraisal protects from overpaying. For refinancing, higher value helps. Context matters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="All appraisals are the same">
    Appraisal quality varies. Appraiser experience, local knowledge, and methodology all affect reliability.
  </Accordion>
