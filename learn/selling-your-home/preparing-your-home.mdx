Preparing a home for sale involves repairs, improvements, staging, and professional photography. The goal is to present the property in its best condition to attract buyers and maximize sale price.

Preparation typically takes 2-4 weeks and should be completed before listing photos are taken.

## Pre-Listing Inspection

A pre-listing inspection is an optional step where the seller hires a home inspector before listing. This allows sellers to identify and address issues before buyers discover them during their own inspection.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Benefits">
    - Identify issues before buyers find them
    - Make repairs proactively on your timeline
    - Price property appropriately based on condition
    - Reduce negotiation surprises
    - Demonstrate transparency to buyers
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When it makes sense">
    - Older homes with unknown condition
    - Properties with deferred maintenance
    - Sellers who want maximum control over the process
    - Competitive markets where surprises kill deals

## Staging Options

Staging prepares the property to appeal to the broadest range of buyers. According to the National Association of Realtors, 81% of buyers' agents say staging makes it easier for clients to visualize a property as their future home.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Vacant staging">
    Rented furniture for empty homes. Most comprehensive and most expensive option. Best for empty properties and higher price points.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Occupied staging">
    Works with existing furniture, supplemented by stager's pieces. Best for lived-in homes where owners haven't moved out.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Partial staging">
    Key rooms only (living room, primary bedroom, kitchen). Best for limited budgets or when only specific areas need attention.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Virtual staging">
    Digital furniture added to photos of empty rooms. Least expensive but only helps online marketing, not in-person showings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consultation only">
    Professional advice with DIY execution. Stager provides recommendations and seller implements. Most affordable option.
  </Accordion>

## Photography and Marketing Materials

Professional photography happens after repairs and staging are complete. Most homebuyers begin their search online, and listings with professional photos receive significantly more views.

    20-40 high-resolution photos covering all main rooms, exterior views, and key features. Professional editing and color correction included.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Video tours">
    Walkthrough videos showing property flow and layout. 1-3 minutes, professionally edited with music. Best for properties with unique character or layout.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Drone photography">
    Aerial shots showing property from above, lot boundaries, and neighborhood context. Best for large lots, waterfront properties, or homes with extensive grounds.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Virtual tours">
