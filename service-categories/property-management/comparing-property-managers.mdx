    When comparing quotes:

    - Request complete fee schedules in writing

    - Ask about fee increases over time

    Use a spreadsheet to compare managers side by side.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Beyond the numbers">
    Lower fees don't always mean better value.

    **Consider:**

    - What's included vs extra
    - Service quality
    - Responsiveness
    - Technology and reporting
    - Reputation and track record
    - Vacancy performance

    A manager with slightly higher fees but better performance may deliver better net returns.
