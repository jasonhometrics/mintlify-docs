## Why Choosing the Right Mover Matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Your belongings are at risk">
    Moving companies take possession of everything you own. Choosing the wrong mover can result in:

    - Damaged or broken items
    - Lost belongings
    - Held-hostage situations (refusing to unload until you pay more)
    - Theft
    - Items never delivered
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Significant financial exposure">
    Moving costs vary widely, and pricing practices aren't always transparent.

    - Low estimates can balloon on moving day
    - Hidden fees may appear
    - Damage claims can be denied
    - Deposits may be non-refundable
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Time-sensitive transaction">
    Moving typically coordinates with real estate closings, lease dates, and job starts.

    - Delays affect closing schedules
    - Storage costs add up quickly
    - Missed delivery windows cause cascading problems
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Industry has fraud problems">
    Moving industry has higher complaint rates than many other service industries.

    - FMCSA receives thousands of complaints annually
    - Rogue movers operate without proper licensing
