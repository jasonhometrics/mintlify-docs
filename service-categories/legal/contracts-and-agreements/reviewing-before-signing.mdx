title: "Reviewing Before Signing"
description: "What to check and when to seek professional review"
---

Contracts create binding legal obligations. Reviewing documents thoroughly before signing prevents costly mistakes, unexpected obligations, and disputes.

Taking time to read and understand contracts is essential, even when other parties pressure quick decisions.

## Why Review Matters

Once signed, contracts are difficult to change or escape. Common consequences of signing without proper review:

- Agreeing to unfavorable terms
- Missing important deadlines
- Waiving valuable protections
- Taking on unexpected costs
- Losing earnest money or deposits
- Legal liability for breach

A few hours of careful review can prevent months of problems.

## What to Review

## Red Flags

<Warning>
**Stop and seek clarification if you see:**

- Blank spaces that should be filled in
- Inconsistent terms (different dates, amounts, or names in different sections)
- Provisions you don't understand
- One-sided terms with no corresponding protections
- Waiver of important rights
- Unusually short deadlines
- Penalties without cure periods
- "As-is" language without understanding implications
- Arbitration clauses waiving right to sue
- Automatic renewal provisions
</Warning>

## Questions to Ask

Before signing, get clear answers to:

**About the transaction:**
- What is my total financial obligation?
- What deadlines must I meet?
- What happens if I miss a deadline?
- What can I do if problems arise?
- How do I terminate if needed?

**About specific terms:**
- What does this provision mean in plain language?
- Why is this term included?
- Is this term negotiable?
- What happens if this condition isn't met?
- What are my obligations under this section?

**About process:**
- When do I need to make decisions?
- Who do I contact with questions?
- What documentation do I need to provide?
- What happens next after signing?

## When to Seek Professional Review

Consider attorney or professional review for:

**Complex transactions:**
- Commercial property purchases or leases
- Multi-family investments
- Properties with tenants
- Unusual property types
- Large financial commitments

**Unusual situations:**
- Non-standard contract terms
- Seller financing
- Lease-to-own arrangements
- Short sales or foreclosures
- Estate or probate sales

**Personal circumstances:**
- First-time buyers or landlords
- Unfamiliar transaction types
- Concerns about specific terms
- Pressure to sign quickly
- Significant financial risk

**Contract issues:**
- Custom-drafted contracts (not standard forms)
- Heavily modified standard forms
- Terms you don't understand
- One-sided provisions
- Waiver of significant rights

<Tip>
Attorney review for a standard residential contract typically costs $200-$500. Compare this to the potential cost of problems from unfavorable terms or missed issues.
</Tip>

## Review Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request time to review">
    Never sign under pressure. Request 24-48 hours minimum for contract review. Legitimate parties will allow reasonable review time.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Read the entire document">
    Read every page, including fine print, addendums, and attachments. Don't skip sections that seem standard.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Highlight questions and concerns">
    Mark anything unclear, concerning, or requiring verification. Create a list of questions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify facts independently">
    Confirm property details, party information, and financial figures match your understanding.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get answers to questions">
    Ask the other party, agent, or attorney to explain unclear provisions. Get explanations in writing if possible.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Negotiate changes if needed">
    Request modifications to unfavorable terms. Everything is negotiable until signed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Seek professional review if warranted">
    For complex or high-stakes transactions, have an attorney review before signing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Keep copies of everything">
    Retain signed copies of all documents, addendums, and amendments.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Mistakes

**Rushing due to pressure**
Urgency is often manufactured. Legitimate transactions allow reasonable review time. Pressure to sign immediately is a warning sign.

**Assuming standard forms are safe**
Standard forms protect both parties to some degree, but terms still vary. Read them anyway.

**Trusting verbal assurances**
"Don't worry about that clause" means nothing if it's in the contract. If terms don't matter, remove them. If they can't be removed, they matter.

**Focusing only on price**
Other terms affect total cost and risk. Contingencies, deadlines, and default provisions matter as much as price.

**Not reading addendums**
Addendums modify the main contract. They may add obligations or remove protections. Review them with the same care as the main document.

**Signing with blanks**
Blank spaces can be filled in later. Never sign documents with important blanks unfilled.

## After Signing

**Keep copies**
Maintain copies of all signed documents in a safe place. Digital and physical copies are recommended.

**Track deadlines**
Create calendar reminders for all deadlines. Missing deadlines can waive rights or trigger default.

**Document everything**
Keep records of all communications, payments, and actions related to the contract.

**Act on contingencies**
If you have contingencies, take required actions within deadlines. Inspections, financing applications, and other conditions require affirmative steps.

**Ask questions early**
If issues arise or terms are unclear after signing, seek clarification immediately. Problems are easier to address early.
