# Mortgage Lenders

**Most buyers start backwards.** They call an agent, tour homes, fall in love with a house, then scramble to get financing approved. By then, it's too late to fix problems.

A proper pre-approval isn't just paperwork. It's your financial safety net that prevents you from wiring $15,000 to a title company for a house you can't actually afford.

<Warning>
**The $15K Mistake:** You get pre-approved in 15 minutes. No tax returns. No income verification. You write an offer. The seller accepts. You wire your earnest money. 30 days later, the lender discovers your bonus income doesn't count. Your loan drops from $400K to $320K. The deal falls through. You lose $15,000.
</Warning>

## Why This Matters

Your lender only gets paid if you close. That creates pressure to keep deals moving forward, even when pausing might be the smartest move.

**The difference between a proper pre-approval and a weak one:**

## What You're Actually Choosing

When you pick a lender, you're not just choosing an interest rate. You're choosing:

**Experience that prevents disasters** - A lender who's closed 180 deals vs. someone who's done 12 knows what problems look like before they blow up your transaction.

**Local relationships that win offers** - When your lender calls the listing agent to verify your financing strength, that relationship can be the difference between your offer and someone else's.

**Communication when seconds matter** - Real estate moves on weekends. If your lender clocks out at 5pm Friday and an offer deadline is Sunday morning, you're at a disadvantage.

<Tip>
**Start with a lender, not an agent.** Get a proper pre-approval that shows exactly what you can afford. Then, once you're confident in your finances, find an agent to help you shop.
</Tip>

## The Local Advantage

National lenders can offer competitive rates. But local lenders who've closed hundreds of deals in your market bring something else:

- They know local appraisers and how properties typically value
- They understand county-specific requirements and timelines
- They have relationships with title companies that prevent closing delays
- Their reputation matters - they can't afford to blow deals

**This doesn't mean national lenders are bad.** It means when rates are similar, local expertise often tips the scale.
