## What to Know Before Selling

Selling inherited property follows the same general process as any home sale, but with additional considerations around probate status, tax timing, multiple heirs, and property condition. Understanding these factors helps heirs navigate the sale successfully.

Most inherited properties sell without major complications. Preparation and clear communication among heirs prevent the issues that do arise.

## Timing Considerations

When to sell affects taxes, legal requirements, and net proceeds.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Selling soon after inheritance">
    Selling shortly after inheritance minimizes capital gains tax. The [stepped-up basis](/learn/inherited-property/tax-implications) equals fair market value at the date of death. If the property sells near that value, little or no gain exists to tax.

    **Advantages:**

    - Minimal capital gains tax exposure
    - Avoids ongoing carrying costs
    - Provides quick resolution for heirs
    - Property condition is documented from recent appraisal

    **Considerations:**

    - May need to wait for [probate](/learn/inherited-property/probate-process) to conclude
    - Market timing may not be optimal
    - Less time to make improvements that could increase value
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Waiting to sell">
    Holding the property allows time for market improvement, property upgrades, or personal circumstances to change.

    **Advantages:**

    - Potential for market appreciation
    - Time to make value-adding improvements
    - Flexibility if an heir may want to keep it later
    - Can [convert to rental](/learn/inherited-property/keeping-as-rental) and defer taxes via [1031 exchange](/service-categories/accountants-tax/1031-exchanges)

    **Considerations:**

    - Ongoing carrying costs (taxes, insurance, maintenance)
    - Capital gains tax on appreciation above stepped-up basis
    - Property may deteriorate if not maintained
    - Continued coordination required among heirs
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Selling during probate">
    Some estates need to sell property before probate concludes to pay debts, taxes, or distribute assets.

    **Requirements:**

    - Court approval typically required
    - Executor must petition for authority to sell
    - Some states require specific sale procedures or court confirmation
    - Buyers should be informed the sale is subject to court approval

    **Considerations:**

    - Process takes longer than standard sales
    - Some buyers avoid probate sales due to uncertainty
    - May affect sale price due to limited buyer pool
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Preparing the Property

Inherited properties often need attention before listing. The deceased may have deferred maintenance, and the home may contain decades of personal belongings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Secure and assess the property">
    Change locks if needed. Document current condition with photos and video. Identify obvious repairs, safety issues, or code violations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get a pre-listing inspection">
    A [professional inspection](/service-categories/home-inspectors/overview) reveals issues that will surface during buyer inspections. Knowing problems upfront allows realistic pricing and avoids surprises.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear personal belongings">
    Remove furniture, clothing, and personal items. Estate sale companies can help sell valuables. Donation services remove items with tax-deductible receipts. Junk removal handles the rest.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make strategic repairs">
    Focus on issues that affect safety, habitability, or buyer financing. Cosmetic updates may not be worthwhile depending on property condition and target buyer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clean and present">
    Deep clean the property. Consider basic [staging](/service-categories/staging-interior-design/staging/overview) if the property shows well. Empty homes can benefit from virtual staging photos.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Disclosure Requirements

Sellers must disclose known material defects. Inherited property presents unique challenges because heirs may have limited knowledge of the property's history.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What heirs typically know">
    Heirs often lack firsthand knowledge of repairs, problems, or property history. Disclose what you know, but you're not required to investigate or discover hidden issues. Review any documents from the estate that might reveal problems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What must be disclosed">
    [Required disclosures](/service-categories/legal/consumer-protections/required-disclosures) vary by state but typically include known issues with:

    - Structural components
    - Roof, plumbing, electrical, HVAC systems
    - Water damage or flooding history
    - Pest infestations
    - Environmental hazards (lead paint, asbestos, mold)
    - Neighborhood nuisances
    - Deaths on the property (in some states)
    
    When uncertain, disclose.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Estate documents">
    Review any records from the estate that reveal property issues: past inspection reports, insurance claims, repair invoices, or correspondence about problems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="State requirements">
    Disclosure requirements vary by state. Some require specific forms. A [real estate attorney](/service-categories/legal/real-estate-attorneys/overview) or experienced agent can advise on local requirements.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Working with Multiple Heirs

When multiple heirs own the property, all must agree on sale decisions and sign closing documents.

**Coordination requirements:**

- All heirs must agree on listing price, agent selection, and offer acceptance
- All heirs sign the listing agreement
- All heirs sign the [purchase contract](/service-categories/legal/contracts-and-agreements/purchase-contracts) and closing documents
- Proceeds are distributed according to ownership shares

**Common challenges:**

| Challenge                    | Resolution Approach                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heirs disagree on price      | Get multiple market analyses; agree to follow agent recommendation                       |
| One heir is unresponsive     | Establish communication deadlines; consider [power of attorney](/service-categories/legal/ownership-changes/power-of-attorney) if appropriate             |
| Heirs in different locations | Use electronic signatures; coordinate with [title company](/service-categories/title-escrow/overview) on remote closings              |
| Disagreement on offer terms  | Establish decision-making process in advance; consider majority rules with [buyout](/service-categories/legal/ownership-changes/buyout-scenarios) option |

<Warning>
  One heir cannot sell the entire property without the others' consent. All owners must participate in the sale or grant authority to someone who can act on their behalf.
</Warning>

## Selecting an Agent

Experience with estate and probate sales matters when selling inherited property.

**Questions to ask agents:**

- How many inherited or estate properties have you sold?
- Are you familiar with probate sale requirements in this state?
- How do you handle communication with multiple heirs?
- What is your approach to properties needing significant work?
- Can you recommend estate sale companies, cleanout services, or contractors?

**What to look for:**

- Experience with similar properties and situations
- Clear communication style that works for all heirs
- Realistic pricing based on property condition
- Network of service providers for preparation needs

## Tax Considerations When Selling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Capital gains calculation">
    Taxable gain equals sale price minus [stepped-up basis](/learn/inherited-property/tax-implications) minus selling costs. If the property sells at or below the stepped-up basis, no capital gains tax is owed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Selling costs that reduce gain">
    Agent commissions, transfer taxes, [title insurance](/service-categories/title-escrow/title-insurance), attorney fees, and other [closing costs](/service-categories/title-escrow/closing-process) add to basis, reducing taxable gain.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Improvement costs">
    Money spent on capital improvements (not routine maintenance) before selling adds to basis. Keep receipts and records.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reporting the sale">
    Report the sale on Schedule D of your tax return. You may need Form 8949 for details. The stepped-up basis date of death value is your cost basis.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
