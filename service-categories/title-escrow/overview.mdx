When property changes hands, title and escrow companies ensure the transfer happens legally and securely. They verify ownership is legitimate, protect funds during the transaction, and coordinate the final transfer.

In some states, real estate attorneys handle this work. In others, title companies perform both functions. The terminology varies by location, but the core responsibilities remain the same.

## What Is Title?

**Title represents legal ownership of property.** Acquiring real estate means obtaining the legal right to own, use, and transfer that property.

Title companies research public records to verify ownership is "clear," meaning:

- No competing ownership claims exist
- No unpaid liens are attached to the property (contractor work, taxes, HOA fees)
- Previous ownership transfers were executed correctly
- No boundary disputes or easement conflicts remain unresolved

**Example:** A seller's ex-spouse forged a signature on a deed during their divorce. Years later, the ex-spouse files suit claiming partial ownership. Without title insurance, the property owner faces legal costs and potential loss of property rights.

Title companies research ownership history (often decades back) and issue title insurance to protect against these risks.

## What Is Escrow?

**Escrow is a neutral holding account.** When large sums transfer during real estate transactions, funds flow through a third-party account rather than directly between parties. This reduces fraud risk and ensures all contract conditions are met before money changes hands.

Common uses of escrow:

- Holding earnest money deposits until closing
- Collecting loan funds from lenders
- Paying off existing mortgages
- Distributing proceeds to sellers
- Covering transaction costs (commissions, taxes, fees)

If a transaction fails to close, escrow protects both parties by holding funds until disputes are resolved according to contract terms.

## Who Chooses The Title Company

Choice varies by state and local custom:

- In some markets, buyers select and pay for title services
- In others, sellers choose and cover costs
- Some areas split responsibilities between buyer and seller
- Transaction contracts specify which party controls the selection

Regardless of local custom, both buyers and sellers have the legal right to choose their own title representation. Lenders may suggest companies but cannot require specific providers.
