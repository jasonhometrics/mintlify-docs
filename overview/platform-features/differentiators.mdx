## How to Use Differentiators

**Combine multiple filters** to find businesses matching your specific needs. For example, search for title companies with wire fraud insurance, weekend availability, and Spanish-speaking staff.

**Verify details directly** when contacting businesses. Differentiators indicate general capabilities, but specific offerings, hours, and terms vary.

**Not all categories apply** to every service type. Some differentiators are more relevant to certain service categories than others.
