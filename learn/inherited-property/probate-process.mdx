Probate is the legal process that validates a deceased person's will, settles their debts, and distributes assets to beneficiaries. For real estate, probate authorizes the transfer of property ownership from the deceased to the heirs.

Probate occurs in the county where the deceased resided. If real estate is located in a different state, a separate ancillary probate may be required in that state.

## When Probate Is Required

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Property titled solely in the deceased's name">
    Real estate owned only by the deceased with no survivorship rights or trust arrangement must go through probate. The court must authorize transfer to the beneficiaries named in the will or determined by intestacy laws.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tenants in common ownership">
    When the deceased owned property as [tenants in common](/service-categories/title-escrow/title-ownership-options) with others, their share passes through probate. The other owners retain their shares, but the deceased's portion transfers according to the will or intestacy laws.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No valid will exists">
    Intestate estates (those without a valid will) require probate. The court appoints an administrator and distributes assets according to state intestacy laws, which prioritize spouses, children, and other relatives.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When Probate Is Not Required

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Property held in a living trust">
    Real estate transferred to a [revocable living trust](/service-categories/legal/ownership-changes/trusts-and-real-estate) before death bypasses probate. The successor trustee distributes trust assets according to trust instructions without court involvement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Joint tenancy with right of survivorship">
    Property owned as [joint tenants](/service-categories/title-escrow/title-ownership-options) automatically transfers to the surviving owner upon death. A death certificate and affidavit of survivorship typically suffice to update title records.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tenancy by the entirety">
    This form of [joint ownership](/service-categories/title-escrow/title-ownership-options), available only to married couples in some states, includes automatic survivorship rights. The surviving spouse becomes sole owner without probate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transfer-on-death deed">
    Some states allow property owners to file a [transfer-on-death (TOD) or beneficiary deed](/service-categories/legal/ownership-changes/transferring-ownership). The property passes directly to the named beneficiary upon death without probate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Small estate procedures">
    Many states offer simplified procedures for estates below a certain value threshold. These expedited processes reduce time and cost compared to formal probate.

## Key Roles in Probate

| Role              | Responsibilities                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Executor**      | Person named in the will to manage the estate. Files probate petition, inventories assets, pays debts, distributes property to beneficiaries. |
| **Administrator** | Court-appointed manager when there is no will or no executor named. Same responsibilities as executor.                                        |
| **Probate Court** | Validates the will, appoints executor/administrator, oversees the process, approves final distribution.                                       |
| **Beneficiaries** | Individuals entitled to receive assets from the estate as named in the will or determined by intestacy laws.                                  |
| **Creditors**     | Entities owed money by the deceased. Must file claims during probate to receive payment from estate assets.                                   |

## Probate Timeline

Probate duration varies by state, estate complexity, and whether disputes arise. Simple estates with valid wills and cooperative beneficiaries move faster than contested or complex cases.

| Phase           | Typical Timeframe | Activities                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Filing          | 1-4 weeks         | Submit death certificate, will, and petition to probate court |
| Appointment     | 2-6 weeks         | Court validates will and officially appoints executor         |
| Notice period   | 1-4 months        | Notify beneficiaries and creditors; creditors file claims     |
| Inventory       | 1-3 months        | Identify and value all estate assets including real estate    |
| Debt settlement | 2-6 months        | Pay valid creditor claims, taxes, and administrative expenses |
| Distribution    | 1-3 months        | Transfer assets to beneficiaries after court approval         |

<Note>
  Total probate duration typically ranges from 6 months to over a year. Contested wills, creditor disputes, or complex assets can extend the process significantly.
</Note>

## Probate Costs

Probate involves several categories of expenses that reduce the amount ultimately distributed to beneficiaries.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Court fees">
    Filing fees for probate petitions, certificates, and court appearances. Vary by state and county, typically ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Attorney fees">
    [Probate attorneys](/service-categories/legal/real-estate-attorneys/overview) charge hourly rates, flat fees, or a percentage of estate value depending on state rules and complexity. Some states set statutory fee schedules.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Executor compensation">
    Executors are entitled to reasonable compensation for their work. Some states specify percentages; others allow "reasonable" fees. Family members sometimes waive compensation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Appraisal and accounting fees">
    [Real estate appraisals](/service-categories/appraisers/overview) establish fair market value for estate inventory and [stepped-up basis](/service-categories/accountants-tax/tax-implications-selling) calculations. Accountants may be needed for tax filings and financial accounting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Property maintenance">
    Ongoing costs to maintain real estate during probate including [insurance](/service-categories/homeowners-insurance/overview), utilities, property taxes, and necessary repairs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Selling Property During Probate

Real estate can sometimes be sold before probate concludes, but the process requires court involvement.

**Court approval requirements:**

- Executor petitions the court for permission to sell
- Court may require appraisal or market analysis
- Some states require public notice of the sale
- Court confirms the sale before closing

**Considerations:**

- Probate sales may take longer due to court scheduling
- Some buyers avoid probate sales due to complexity and uncertainty
- Sale proceeds become part of the estate for distribution

<Warning>
  Executors cannot sell estate property without proper court authorization. Unauthorized sales can result in personal liability for the executor.
</Warning>

## What Heirs Should Do During Probate

| Action                    | Why It Matters                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Secure the property       | Prevent vandalism, theft, or damage. Change locks if needed.                                                |
| Maintain insurance        | Keep existing coverage active or obtain estate coverage. Lapsed insurance creates risk.                     |
| Document condition        | Photograph the property and note existing conditions for estate records.                                    |
| Pay ongoing expenses      | Property taxes, utilities, and necessary maintenance should continue. These are legitimate estate expenses. |
| Avoid major changes       | Do not renovate, remove items, or make significant changes without executor approval.                       |
| Communicate with co-heirs | Stay informed and aligned on decisions to prevent disputes.                                                 |
