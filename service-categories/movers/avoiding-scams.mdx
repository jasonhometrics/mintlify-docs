The moving industry has higher fraud rates than many other service industries. Rogue movers, bait-and-switch pricing, and held-hostage situations occur regularly. Understanding common scams and red flags helps consumers avoid becoming victims.

Verification and due diligence are essential when hiring movers.

## Common Moving Scams

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The lowball estimate">
    **How it works:**
    - Mover gives extremely low estimate
    - You book based on attractive price
    - On moving day, price increases dramatically
    - Your belongings are on the truck when they demand more money
    
    **Result:** Pay inflated price or have belongings held hostage.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Hostage load">
    **How it works:**
    - Mover loads your belongings
    - At destination (or during transit), demands more money
    - Refuses to unload until you pay
    - May threaten to sell or store your items
    
    **Result:** Pay ransom or lose belongings.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The disappearing mover">
    **How it works:**
    - Mover takes deposit
    - Never shows up on moving day
    - Phone disconnected, can't be reached
    - Company doesn't actually exist
    
    **Result:** Lost deposit, scramble for last-minute alternative.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Weight bump">
    **How it works:**
    - Long-distance move priced by weight
    - Mover inflates weight through fake weighing
    - May weigh truck with extra items or people
    - You pay for weight you don't have
    
    **Result:** Overpay based on fraudulent weight.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Hidden damage/theft">
    **How it works:**
    - Items disappear during move
    - Damage blamed on you ("packed by owner")
    - Claims denied or underpaid
    - Items replaced with inferior substitutes
    
    **Result:** Lost or damaged items with no recourse.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Fake reviews">
    **How it works:**
    - Company creates fake positive reviews
    - Buries negative reviews
    - Uses fake names and review patterns
    - Appears reputable when it isn't
    
    **Result:** You hire based on false reputation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
If your belongings are held hostage, don't pay inflated amounts. Document everything, contact FMCSA, local police, and consider legal action. Paying ransom rewards the scam.

## Lead Generation Sites

    Some websites collect moving requests and sell leads to movers.
    
    **Process:**
    - You enter move details
    - Site sells your info to multiple movers
    - Movers contact you (often aggressively)

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Broker vs Carrier

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What brokers do">
    Moving brokers arrange transportation but don't perform moves.
    
    - Take your booking
    - Subcontract to actual moving company
    - May have little control over service
    - You may not know who's actually moving you
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Risks with brokers">
    - Less accountability
    - Price changes when carrier assigned
    - Quality varies by subcontractor
    - Harder to resolve problems
    - May be unlicensed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How to identify">
    Ask directly: "Will your company perform the move, or do you use subcontractors?"
    
    Brokers often:
    - Resist answering
    - Say they use "partner carriers"
    - Can't tell you which truck until close to move date
    
    Carriers perform moves with own trucks and employees.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="If using broker">
    - Verify broker is licensed
    - Get carrier information before move
    - Verify carrier separately
