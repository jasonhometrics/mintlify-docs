---

Title and escrow companies verify legal ownership and manage funds during real estate transactions. They research property history, issue insurance against ownership disputes, hold deposits securely, and coordinate closings.

In some states, real estate attorneys handle these functions. In others, title companies perform both roles. The terminology varies by location, but the core responsibilities remain the same.
