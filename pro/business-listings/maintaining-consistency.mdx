title: "Maintaining Consistency"
description: "Systems for keeping listing information accurate and monitoring for changes"
---

Listing consistency requires ongoing attention. Information changes over time, platforms update automatically from data sources, and users submit corrections that may introduce errors.

A maintenance system prevents the gradual drift that erodes [NAP consistency](/pro/business-listings/overview#nap-consistency) and search visibility.

## What Must Stay Consistent

### Core NAP Elements

These elements must match exactly across all platforms:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Business Name" icon="building">
    Exact legal or DBA name without added keywords, locations, or variations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Street Address" icon="location-dot">
    Same format for street type, suite designation, and secondary address lines
  </Card>
  <Card title="Phone Number" icon="phone">
    Same primary number with consistent formatting
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Extended Information

Beyond NAP, these elements should also align across platforms:

| Element | Consistency Requirement |
|---------|------------------------|
| Website URL | Same URL everywhere, including or excluding "www" consistently |
| Business hours | Matching hours, including holiday schedules |
| Categories | Equivalent category selections on each platform |
| Service areas | Same geographic coverage defined |
| Description | Consistent core messaging (exact match not required) |

<Info>
Minor wording differences in descriptions are acceptable. The goal is consistent facts and messaging, not identical text everywhere.
</Info>

## Creating a Consistency Standard

Document the official format for each element. This reference prevents variations when updating listings or creating new ones.

</Tip>

## Monitoring for Changes

Listings can change without business action. Sources of unauthorized changes include:

- User-submitted corrections (sometimes incorrect)
- Data aggregator updates overwriting manual edits
- Platform algorithm changes to formatting
- Competitors or bad actors suggesting false edits

### Monitoring Methods

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Manual Checks">
    Visit each major listing periodically and verify information accuracy. Simple but time-consuming. Best for businesses with few listings.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Google Alerts">
    Set up alerts for the business name to catch new mentions and potential new listings. Free but limited to indexed content.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Listing Management Tools">
    Services like Yext, Moz Local, and BrightLocal monitor listings and alert to changes. Paid but comprehensive. Some also prevent unauthorized edits.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Platform Notifications">
    Google Business Profile sends notifications for suggested edits. Enable these alerts and review suggestions promptly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Google allows any user to suggest edits to business listings. These edits may be accepted automatically based on Google's algorithms. Regular monitoring catches incorrect changes before they propagate.
</Warning>

## Handling Changes

When business information changes, all listings must be updated systematically.

### Change Management Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update the standards document">
    Revise the official information record with new details before making any platform changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update data aggregators first">
    Changes submitted to [aggregators](/pro/business-listings/types-of-listings#data-aggregators) propagate to downstream directories over time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update priority platforms directly">
    Manually update Google, Bing, Apple, Yelp, and other Tier 1 listings. Do not wait for aggregator propagation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update remaining listings">
    Work through Tier 2 and Tier 3 platforms systematically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor propagation">
    Check downstream directories over the following weeks to confirm aggregator changes have taken effect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Address Change Considerations

Address changes require extra attention:

- Update mail forwarding to catch verification postcards sent to old address
- Expect 4-8 weeks for full propagation through aggregator networks
- Old address may persist on some platforms; revisit and correct
- Consider whether phone number should also change

### Phone Number Change Considerations

- Keep old number active during transition if possible
- Forward old number to new number to capture misdirected calls
- Prioritize platforms where phone number is the primary contact method

## Common Maintenance Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Updating some platforms but not others">
    Partial updates create inconsistency. Track all listings and update systematically.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using tracking phone numbers inconsistently">
    Different tracking numbers on different platforms look like NAP inconsistency to search engines. Use the main number everywhere, or use a single tracking number consistently.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Letting employees create listings independently">
    Multiple people creating profiles leads to duplicates and variations. Centralize listing management.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Ignoring auto-generated listings">
    Listings created by aggregators or users may contain errors. Claim and correct rather than ignoring.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Forgetting seasonal hour changes">
    Holiday hours, summer schedules, and special closures require updates across all platforms. Update in advance and revert after.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency | Time Required |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Quick check of major listings | Weekly | 10-15 minutes |
| Full audit of all known listings | Quarterly | 1-2 hours |
| Review and update hours | Before holidays | 30 minutes |
| Check for new auto-generated listings | Monthly | 20-30 minutes |
| Aggregator resubmission (if changes made) | As needed | 30 minutes |

<Check>
Consistent listings maintained over time compound in value. Search engines develop increasing confidence in business information, and AI tools are more likely to recommend businesses with reliable data.
