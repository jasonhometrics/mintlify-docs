title: "Using Differentiators Effectively"
description: "Choosing differentiators that reflect real operations and increase trust"
---

Differentiators help customers compare similar providers more easily. They function as filters, not promises. Customers use differentiators to answer questions like: Who responds quickly? Who offers consultations? Who has experience with my situation?
