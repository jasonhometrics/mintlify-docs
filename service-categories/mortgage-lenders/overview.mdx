# Mortgage Lenders

**Unless you're paying cash, you need a mortgage lender.** They're the financial institution that loans you the money to buy your home.

Most people focus on interest rates when choosing a lender. That matters. But the lender you choose also determines whether your offer gets accepted, whether you close on time, and whether you discover deal-breaking problems before or after you're under contract.

## What Mortgage Lenders Do

A mortgage lender evaluates your finances, determines how much they're willing to loan you, and funds your home purchase at closing.

**Here's what that looks like in practice:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-Approval">
    They review your income, credit, and debts to determine your loan amount. This happens before you start shopping for homes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Loan Processing">
    Once you're under contract, they verify everything, order an appraisal, and prepare your loan for underwriting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Underwriting">
    A separate team reviews all documentation to confirm you qualify for the loan amount and meet program requirements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Closing">
    They wire funds to the title company so you can complete your purchase.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Your lender is involved from day one until you get your keys.** When something goes wrong (and it often does), their experience determines whether the deal survives or falls apart.

## Why Your Choice Matters

Not all lenders operate the same way. Some do thorough financial reviews upfront. Others rubber-stamp approvals and discover problems 30 days later when you're already under contract.

## Types of Lenders

**Banks and Credit Unions** National or regional institutions. Often offer competitive rates but may have limited weekend availability and slower response times.

**Mortgage Brokers** Work with multiple lenders to find you the best rate and program. Can offer more options but add another layer to the process.

**Direct Lenders** Dedicated mortgage companies. Often more responsive and experienced in residential lending, with staff available outside traditional banking hours.

**Hard Money Lenders** Work with investors...

<Note>
  **No single type is automatically better.** What matters is the individual loan officer's experience, communication style, and track record in your market.
</Note>

## What to Expect

**Timeline:** Pre-approval takes 1-3 days with proper documentation. Full loan processing takes 30-45 days from contract to closing.

**Cost:** Lenders charge origination fees (typically 0.5-1% of loan amount) plus other processing costs. Rates and fees vary significantly between lenders.

**Documentation:** Expect to provide W2s, tax returns, pay stubs, bank statements, and employment verification.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Pre-qualified means I'm ready to buy"** No. Pre-qualification is an estimate based on what you tell them. Pre-approval involves verification and documentation.

**"I should just use whoever my agent recommends"** Your agent's preferred lender might be great. But you should interview at least 3 options before committing.

**"The lowest rate is always the best deal"** Rate matters. But a low rate with inexperienced execution can cost you more when deals fall through or close late.
