# What to Expect

Title and escrow services run throughout the transaction from contract signing to closing day. Understanding the timeline, requirements, and common scenarios helps everyone involved stay prepared.

<Note>
The following timeline reflects a typical 30-day purchase transaction. Refinances and cash purchases follow different schedules. Your specific timeline may vary based on contract terms, lender requirements, and local practices.
</Note>

## Understanding Earnest Money

When buyers make an offer on a property, they include earnest money to show they're serious. This deposit goes into a protected account and stays there until the deal closes or falls apart.

**How much:** Usually 1-3% of the sale price. On a $300,000 house, that's between $3,000 and $9,000.

**When it's due:** Buyers have 3 business days after the contract is signed to send the money. Missing this deadline can result in legal action from the seller.

**Where it goes:** The title company holds it in an escrow account. The seller can't touch it. Nobody can touch it until the contract says they can.

### What Happens to It

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="If the deal closes">
    The earnest money counts toward what the buyer owes at closing. It's not extra money on top of the down payment. It's part of it.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="If the deal falls through for a valid reason">
    Buyers get their money back when:
    - The lender denies their loan
    - The home inspection finds major problems and the seller won't fix them
    - The appraisal comes in too low
    - The title company finds ownership problems they can't fix
    - Other conditions in the contract aren't met
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="If the buyer backs out without a valid reason">
    The seller may keep the earnest money. This happens when:
    - Buyers change their mind for no contractual reason
    - Buyers miss important deadlines in the contract
    - Buyers refuse to close after all conditions are met
    
    The contract explains exactly what happens if there's a disagreement about who keeps the deposit.
  </Accordion>

<Warning>
**Always verify wire instructions by phone before sending earnest money.** Look up the title company's phone number yourself. Don't trust numbers in emails. Scammers send fake wire instructions that look real.
</Warning>

## What Happens After Closing

**Recording:** The deed and mortgage get filed with the county. This makes the ownership change official and public. Usually happens the same day or next business day after signing.

**Title insurance:** The owner's policy arrives 30-60 days after closing. Keep this document forever. It protects ownership for as long as the owner or their heirs own the property.

**Final documents:** Complete closing package (deed, mortgage, settlement statement, title insurance commitment) delivered within 30 days.

**Questions:** Title company remains available to answer questions about recorded documents, insurance coverage, or how funds were distributed.

## Common Misconceptions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='"The lender chooses the title company"'>
    Buyers and sellers have the legal right to choose title representation. Lenders may recommend companies but cannot require specific providers. Local customs vary on whether buyer or seller selects.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title='"All title companies charge the same"'>
    Title insurance premiums are often state-regulated, but settlement fees and other charges vary significantly. Comparing quotes can save money.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title='"Title insurance only protects the lender"'>
    Two separate policies exist. Lender's policy protects the lender. Owner's policy protects the buyer. Both serve different purposes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title='"Earnest money is lost if financing falls through"'>
    Financing contingencies protect buyers. If lenders deny loans despite good-faith efforts, buyers receive refunds. Deposits are only at risk if buyers breach contract without valid reason.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title='"Notaries can answer questions during closing"'>
    Notaries witness signatures and verify identity. They cannot provide legal advice or explain terms. Licensed settlement agents can answer questions and provide guidance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title='"Wire instructions sent by email are safe"'>
    Email accounts are frequently compromised in fraud schemes. Always verify instructions via phone using independently looked-up contact information.
