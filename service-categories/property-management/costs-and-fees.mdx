Property management fees vary by service level, property type, location, and company. Understanding fee structures helps owners compare options and anticipate total management costs.

Most managers charge a combination of ongoing fees and transaction-based fees.

<Note>
  Property management fees vary significantly by location and provider. The ranges below represent typical industry structures as of 2024-2025, but actual rates depend on your market, property type, and specific provider. Always get quotes from multiple managers for accurate comparison.

## Common Fee Structures

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Percentage of rent">
    Most common structure for residential management.

    **How it works:**

    - Manager charges percentage of collected rent
    - Fee only applies when rent is collected
    - Typical range: 8% to 12% of monthly rent

    > **Example:**
    >
    > - Monthly rent: \$2,000
    > - Management fee (10%): 200/month
    > - Annual cost: \$2,400

    Aligns manager incentive with keeping property rented and rent collected.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Flat monthly fee">
    Fixed amount regardless of rent level.

    **How it works:**

    - Set monthly fee
    - Same fee regardless of rent amount
    - May adjust annually

    **When used:**

    - Higher-rent properties (where percentage would be excessive)
    - Lower-rent properties (where percentage wouldn't cover costs)
    - Simplified billing preference

    May or may not apply during vacancies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hybrid structures">
    Combination approaches:

    - Base fee plus percentage
    - Different rates for different services
    - Tiered percentages based on rent level
    - Performance bonuses

    Common for portfolios or custom arrangements.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Standard Fees

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Monthly management fee">
    Ongoing fee for management services.

    **Residential properties:** Typically 8% to 12% of collected rent. The national average is approximately 8% to 10%.

    Minimum monthly fees often apply for lower-rent properties.

    Multi-family, commercial, and specialty properties have different fee structures. Request quotes for your specific property type.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Leasing/placement fee">
    One-time fee when placing new tenant.

    **Typical range:** 50% to 100% of first month's rent

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lease renewal fee">
    Fee for renewing existing tenant.

    Fees vary significantly by location and provider. Some managers charge a flat fee, some charge a percentage of rent, and some include renewals in the monthly management fee.

    Generally less than placement fee since less work is involved.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Setup/onboarding fee">
    One-time fee when starting management.

    Covers initial property assessment, document setup, system entry, and initial inspections.

    Fees vary significantly by location and provider. Some managers waive this fee.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Total Cost

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Calculating annual cost">
    To estimate total management cost:

    1. Monthly management fee x 12 months
    2. Add expected leasing fees (based on turnover)
    3. Add renewal fees
    4. Add estimated additional fees
    5. Factor in maintenance markups if applicable

    Turnover significantly increases annual cost due to leasing fees and vacancy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Comparing quotes">
    When comparing managers:

    - Calculate total estimated annual cost, not just monthly percentage
    - Ensure you're comparing same services
    - Understand what's included vs extra
    - Ask about typical additional charges
    - Consider service quality, not just price

    Lower percentage doesn't always mean lower total cost.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hidden costs to watch">
    Review contracts for:

    - Fees during vacancy
    - Cancellation fees
    - Per-communication fees
    - Administrative fees
    - Required vendor usage
    - Automatic renewal clauses
    - Fee increase provisions

    All fees should be clearly documented in the management agreement.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Negotiating Fees

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's negotiable">
    Commonly negotiable items:

    - Management percentage (especially for multiple properties)
    - Leasing fees
    - Setup fees
    - Renewal fees
    - Contract terms

    Managers are more flexible for desirable properties and portfolios.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Leverage points">
    Factors that strengthen negotiating position:

    - Multiple properties
    - Well-maintained property
    - Desirable location
    - Long-term commitment
    - Current reliable tenant in place
    - Willingness to sign longer contract
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What to prioritize">
    Focus negotiations on:

    - Fees that occur frequently (monthly, turnover)
    - Large one-time fees (leasing)
    - Fees that compound (maintenance markup)

    Small per-occurrence fees matter less than recurring costs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Fee Red Flags

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Unusually low fees">
    Very low fees may indicate:

    - Hidden fees elsewhere
    - Inexperienced manager
    - High volume, low service model
    - Fees recovered through other charges
    - Short-term introductory rate

    Understand how they make money if fees seem too low.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Excessive or unclear fees">
    Watch for:

    - Fees for routine communications
    - High markup on every service
    - Multiple fees for same activity
    - Non-refundable reserves
    - Unreasonable cancellation penalties
    - Vague fee descriptions
    - Fees not in writing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Value vs Cost

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What good management provides">
    Higher fees may be justified by:

    - Better tenant screening (fewer evictions)
    - Faster leasing (less vacancy)
    - Higher tenant retention
    - Better maintenance (preserved value)
    - Accurate accounting
    - Legal compliance
    - Time savings
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Calculating value">
    Consider total return, not just fees:

    - Vacancy rate and days to lease
    - Tenant quality and retention
    - Rent optimization
    - Maintenance cost control
    - Owner time saved

    A manager with higher fees but lower vacancy and better tenants may deliver better net returns.
