title: "Removing Names from Title"
description: "Taking someone off property ownership"
---

Removing a name from property title requires a new deed transferring that person's ownership interest. The process varies based on why the name is being removed and whether a mortgage exists.

A name cannot simply be "deleted" from title. The person must sign their interest away.

## Common Reasons

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Divorce">
    Ex-spouse transfers their interest to the spouse keeping the property. Usually required by divorce decree.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Death of co-owner">
    Deceased owner's name removed. Process depends on how title was held (survivorship, tenants in common, trust).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Buyout of co-owner">
    One owner purchases another's share. Selling owner transfers their interest via deed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Removing ex-partner (not married)">
    Unmarried co-owners separating. Requires agreement since no divorce court to order transfer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Parent removing child (or vice versa)">
    Family member added previously now needs to be removed. Common when circumstances change.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Correcting a mistake">
    Name added incorrectly or person no longer intended to be on title. May require corrective deed or other legal action.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The Basic Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Determine ownership type">
    Review current deed to understand how title is held and each owner's rights.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get agreement (if person is living)">
    Person being removed must agree to sign deed. Cannot force removal without court order.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Address mortgage issues">
    If mortgage exists, determine how to handle (refinance, assumption, or leave as-is with risks).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare new deed">
    Quitclaim deed most common for removing names. Must include correct legal description.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign and notarize">
    Person being removed signs before notary. Some states require witnesses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Record with county">
    File deed with county recorder to update public records. Pay recording fee.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## By Scenario

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Joint tenancy with survivorship">
    When one owner dies, surviving owner automatically owns entire property.

    **To update title:**

    - Obtain certified death certificate
    - File affidavit of survivorship (form varies by state)
    - Record with county

    No deed from deceased needed. No probate required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tenants in common">
    When one owner dies, their share passes through their estate (by will or intestate law), not automatically to co-owner.

    **To update title:**

    - Probate may be required
    - Executor or administrator signs deed to beneficiaries
    - If beneficiary is co-owner, they receive deceased's share

    More complex than survivorship. May require attorney.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Divorce">
    Divorce decree typically orders one spouse to transfer interest to the other.

    **To update title:**

    - Obtain signed divorce decree
    - Departing spouse signs quitclaim deed
    - Record deed with county

    Decree alone doesn't transfer title. Deed still required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Living person voluntarily">
    Person agrees to be removed. Common in buyouts or family situations.

    **To update title:**

    - Agree on any compensation
    - Person signs quitclaim deed
    - Record deed

    Straightforward if person cooperates and no disputes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Person refuses to sign">
    Cannot force someone off title without legal action.

    **Options:**

    - Negotiate or mediate
    - Partition action (court-ordered sale)
    - Quiet title action (if they have no valid claim)
    - Enforce divorce decree or other court order

    Requires attorney. Can be expensive and time-consuming.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The Mortgage Problem

<Warning>
  Removing a name from title does not remove that person from mortgage liability. These are separate legal matters. Until the loan is refinanced or paid off, all original borrowers remain responsible.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why this matters">
    Person removed from title has:

    - No ownership rights
    - No ability to sell or control property
    - Continued liability if payments stop
    - Credit damage if mortgage defaults

    This is a significant risk for the departing owner.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Options to address">
    **Refinance:** Remaining owner refinances in their name only. Best solution but requires qualification.

    **Loan assumption:** New owner formally assumes loan, releasing original borrower. Rarely available on residential mortgages.

    **Sell property:** Pay off mortgage entirely. Clean break for both parties.

    **Accept the risk:** Departing owner remains on loan but trusts remaining owner to pay. Risky but sometimes unavoidable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Protective measures">
    If refinance isn't possible immediately:

    - Written agreement on payment responsibility
    - Indemnification clause (departing owner can sue if stuck paying)
    - Deadline for refinance
    - Right to force sale if refinance doesn't happen

    These protect departing owner's legal rights but don't prevent credit damage if payments stop.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deed Types for Removal

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quitclaim deed">
    Most common for removing names. Transfers whatever interest the person has with no warranties.

    Fast, simple, inexpensive. Appropriate when parties know each other and no sale is involved.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Warranty deed">
    Provides guarantees about clear title. Typically used in sales, not name removals.

    May be appropriate if remaining owner wants title insurance or protection against unknown claims.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Interspousal transfer deed">
    Available in some states specifically for transfers between spouses. May have tax advantages or simplified recording.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tax Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Between spouses">
    Transfers between spouses (during marriage or incident to divorce) are not taxable events. No gift tax or capital gains triggered.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="To non-spouse">
    May be considered a gift (if no payment) or sale (if payment received).

    **Gift:** May require gift tax return if value exceeds annual exclusion (currently 18,000). Usually no tax owed but reporting required.

    **Sale:** Person removed may owe capital gains on their share of appreciation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transfer taxes">
    Some states charge transfer taxes on deed recordings. Exemptions often exist for divorce transfers, family gifts, or transfers without consideration.

    Check local requirements before recording.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Special Situations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Deceased owner's estate is unsettled">
    Cannot remove deceased owner until estate is resolved. May need probate to establish who inherits their share.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Owner is incapacitated">
    Person with power of attorney may be able to sign on their behalf. Must have specific authority for real estate transactions.

    If no POA exists, court-appointed guardianship may be required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Owner cannot be located">
    May require quiet title action. Court determines ownership based on evidence presented.

    Expensive and time-consuming. Title insurance may be difficult to obtain afterward.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lien holder on title">
    Liens (tax liens, judgment liens, mechanic's liens) must be resolved separately. Removing a person doesn't remove liens against their interest.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Costs

Typical costs for removing a name from title:

- Deed preparation (attorney or title company): \$100 - \$300
- Notary fee: \$10 - \$50
- Recording fee: \$25 - \$100
- Transfer tax (if applicable): varies widely by location

If refinancing is involved, add refinance closing costs (typically 2% to 5% of loan amount).
