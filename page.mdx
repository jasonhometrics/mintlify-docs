  <Accordion title="Website">

## Photos and Branding

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Logo">
    - High-resolution logo uploaded
    - Logo displays correctly in both light and dark modes
    - Logo matches branding on website and other platforms
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Team and environment photos">

</AccordionGroup>

## Critical Links

Include links that reduce friction for customers:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Website" icon="globe">
    Your primary business website
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quote or intake form" icon="file-lines">
    Direct link to request quotes or start intake process
  </Card>
  <Card title="Booking link" icon="calendar">
    Calendar or scheduling tool for appointments
  </Card>
  <Card title="Application link" icon="pen-to-square">
    Loan applications, rental applications, or other forms
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Make next steps obvious. Every additional click reduces conversion.

## Differentiators

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Select only what you can support consistently">
    Differentiators should reflect your normal operations, not aspirational goals or occasional exceptions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Avoid over-selection">
    Selecting every available differentiator dilutes impact and creates skepticism. Choose what genuinely distinguishes your operations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Confirm differentiators reflect real operations">
    Before selecting, ask: Can we support this consistently? Would a customer notice if this were missing?
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
