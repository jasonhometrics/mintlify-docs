## How Badges Are Monitored

Badges are recalculated regularly based on current activity. If performance drops below badge criteria, the badge is removed automatically.

We also monitor for suspicious patterns:
- Sudden unnatural spikes in reviews
- Review content that appears duplicated or generated
- Timing patterns inconsistent with normal business activity

Professionals showing these patterns may have badges suspended pending review, even if they meet the technical criteria.
