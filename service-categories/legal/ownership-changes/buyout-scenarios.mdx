title: "Buyout Scenarios"
description: "One owner buying out another"
---

A buyout occurs when one property owner purchases another owner's share. Common in divorce, inherited property with multiple heirs, and co-ownership situations where one party wants sole ownership.

Understanding the process helps both sides reach fair agreements.

## When Buyouts Happen

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Divorce">
    One spouse keeps the home and pays the other their share of equity. Most common buyout scenario.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inherited property">
    Multiple heirs inherit together. One wants to keep the property; others want cash.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Investment partnerships">
    One partner exits while others continue. Departing partner receives their ownership share.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Co-owner disagreement">
    Joint owners disagree on keeping vs selling. One buys out the other to resolve the conflict.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Business dissolution">
    LLC or partnership dissolves. One member buys property from entity or other members.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Calculating Buyout Amount

**Basic formula:**

Property value minus mortgage balance equals total equity. Multiply by departing owner's ownership percentage.

> **Example:**
>
> - Home value: \$400,000
> - Mortgage balance: \$250,000
> - Total equity: \$150,000
> - Departing owner's share (50%): \$75,000 buyout

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Determining property value">
    **Options:**

    - Professional appraisal (recommended for significant value)
    - Comparative market analysis from real estate agent
    - Agreed value between parties
    - Average of multiple valuations

    For contested buyouts, independent appraisal provides objective basis.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ownership percentages">
    Check the deed for ownership shares. If not specified, most states assume equal ownership.

    Some situations involve unequal shares based on contributions, agreements, or court orders.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Adjustments to consider">
    Buyout amount may be adjusted for:

    - Deferred maintenance or needed repairs
    - Selling costs avoided (agent commissions, closing costs)
    - One party's contributions to mortgage or improvements
    - Outstanding liens or obligations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Selling costs are often factored into buyouts. If selling would cost 6% in commissions plus closing costs, a buyout might discount by 3-4% since those costs are avoided.
</Note>

## Funding the Buyout

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cash-out refinance">
    Most common method. Keeping owner refinances for higher amount, uses extra funds to pay departing owner.

    **Requirements:**

    - Sufficient equity
    - Keeping owner qualifies alone
    - Lender approves higher loan amount

    **Example:** Current mortgage is \$250,000. Refinance for \$325,000. Use \$75,000 to buy out co-owner.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Home equity loan or HELOC">
    Second loan against property provides buyout funds. Original mortgage stays in place.

    **Considerations:**

    - Two payments instead of one
    - May have higher interest rate
    - Requires sufficient equity
    - Original co-owner may still be on first mortgage
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personal savings or other assets">
    Pay buyout from savings, investments, or other sources.

    Works when buyout amount is manageable and keeping owner wants to avoid refinancing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Seller financing">
    Departing owner accepts payments over time instead of lump sum.

    **Structure:**

    - Promissory note documents terms
    - May be secured by property (second lien)
    - Interest rate and payment schedule negotiated

    Risk for departing owner if payments stop. May require legal enforcement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Asset trade">
    Instead of cash, departing owner receives other assets of equivalent value.

    Common in divorce: one spouse gets house, other gets retirement accounts or investments.

    **Watch for:** Tax implications differ by asset type. Equivalent dollar amounts may not be equal after taxes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The Buyout Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agree on value">
    Get appraisal or agree on property value. This determines buyout amount.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calculate equity and buyout">
    Subtract mortgage from value. Multiply by departing owner's share. Negotiate any adjustments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Determine funding method">
    Refinance, home equity loan, cash, or other arrangement. Keeping owner must qualify.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Draft agreement">
    Written agreement specifies buyout amount, payment terms, timeline, and contingencies. Attorney recommended.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete financing">
    Refinance closes or other funding secured. Lender removes departing owner from mortgage (if refinancing).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute deed transfer">
    Departing owner signs quitclaim deed transferring their interest.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Distribute funds and record deed">
    Departing owner receives payment. Deed recorded with county.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mortgage Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Removing departing owner from loan">
    Refinancing is typically the only way to remove someone from a mortgage. Lenders rarely release borrowers without refinance.

    Until removed, departing owner remains liable even after signing away ownership.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Qualifying alone">
    Keeping owner must qualify for mortgage using only their income and credit. If unable to qualify, buyout may not be possible.

    Options if qualification is difficult:

    - Smaller loan amount (larger down payment)
    - Co-signer (creates new liability issues)
    - Wait until financial situation improves
    - Sell instead of buyout
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Timing coordination">
    Deed transfer and refinance should happen together. Departing owner shouldn't sign deed until refinance removes them from loan.

    Title company or attorney can coordinate closing both simultaneously.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Never transfer your ownership before being removed from the mortgage. You would have no ownership but remain liable for the debt.
</Warning>

## When Buyouts Fail

If parties cannot agree on buyout terms:

**Negotiation and mediation** Neutral third party helps reach agreement. Less expensive than court.

**Partition action** Any co-owner can file lawsuit forcing sale. Court orders property sold and proceeds divided. Expensive, adversarial, and may result in below-market sale.

**Continued co-ownership** Maintain status quo if no one can afford buyout and no one wants forced sale. Requires cooperation and clear expense-sharing agreement.

## Tax Implications

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Divorce transfers">
    Transfers between spouses incident to divorce are not taxable. No capital gains at transfer time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Non-divorce buyouts">
    May be treated as sale by departing owner. Capital gains tax may apply on their share of appreciation.

    Consult tax professional for specific situation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Basis for keeping owner">
    Keeping owner's basis includes original purchase price plus buyout amount paid. Important for calculating future capital gains.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Protecting Both Parties

<Tip>
  **For departing owner:**

  - Get independent appraisal
  - Don't sign deed until removed from mortgage
  - Get buyout agreement in writing
  - Consider title insurance for seller financing
  - Verify funds received before signing deed

  **For keeping owner:**

  - Ensure you can afford the property alone
  - Get pre-approved for refinance before agreeing to terms
  - Factor in all ownership costs, not just mortgage
  - Document any adjustments to buyout amount
  - Complete transaction promptly
