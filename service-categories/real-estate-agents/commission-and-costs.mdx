description: "How agents are paid and what it costs"

Real estate agents typically work on commission, earning payment only when a transaction closes. Understanding how commission works helps buyers and sellers budget appropriately and negotiate effectively.

Commission structures and amounts vary by market and are negotiable.

## How Commission Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Commission basics">
    Real estate commission is a fee paid for agent services, typically calculated as a percentage of the property sale price.
    
    **Key points:**
    - Paid at closing from sale proceeds
    - No sale means no commission
    - Amount is negotiable
    - Split between multiple parties
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Who pays commission">
    **Traditional model:** Seller pays total commission out of sale proceeds at closing.
    
    **Buyer-paid commission:** In some markets or situations, buyers may compensate their own agent directly through buyer-broker agreement.
    
    **Recent changes:** Real estate commission practices have evolved. The traditional model where sellers pay both agents' commissions is no longer universal. Buyers should discuss commission arrangements with their agent upfront.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Commission split">
    Total commission is divided:
    
    1. **Seller pays** total commission (traditional model)
    2. **Split between brokerages:** Listing brokerage and buyer's brokerage each receive a portion
    3. **Split between broker and agent:** Each brokerage splits its portion with the individual agent
    
    **Example:**
    - $400,000 sale price
    - 5% total commission = $20,000
    - Split: $10,000 to listing side, $10,000 to buyer's side
    - Each brokerage keeps portion and pays agent remainder based on their agreement
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Typical Commission Rates

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Market variations">
    Commission rates vary significantly by location and market conditions. There is no standard or typical rate.
    
    Rates are always negotiable between seller and listing agent.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Factors affecting commission">
    Commission may be influenced by:
    
    - Local market customs
    - Property price (higher-priced homes may have lower percentage)
    - Property condition and marketability
    - Services provided
    - Competition among agents
    - Market conditions (hot vs slow market)
    - Complexity of transaction
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Luxury properties">
    High-value properties often have lower commission percentages but higher dollar amounts.
    
    A $2 million property might have a lower percentage rate than a $300,000 property, but still results in substantial compensation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Alternative Fee Structures

    **When used:**

    **Considerations:** Ensure services provided meet your needs at the flat fee offered.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tiered commission">
    Different rates at different price points.
    
    **Example:** Higher percentage on first $500,000, lower percentage above that amount.

    Rare in residential real estate. More common with:
    - Real estate consultants
    - Specific advisory services
