Hometrics brings all real estate service providers into one searchable directory. Compare professionals based on verified reviews, filter by your specific needs, and connect directly without sharing contact information.

## How It Works

Hometrics aggregates verified customer reviews from Google Business Profiles and organizes professionals into 13 service categories covering every aspect of real estate transactions.

**Review Aggregation**

All reviews displayed on Hometrics come from Google Business Profiles. Reviews are not collected, modified, or filtered by the platform. What you see reflects actual customer experiences.

**Performance Badges**

Hometrics assigns [performance badges](/overview/performance-badges) to businesses that demonstrate consistent service quality through verified customer reviews and engagement patterns. Badges help you quickly identify high-performing providers.

**Search and Filtering**

Search by service type, location, and specific criteria relevant to each category. Filter results by rating thresholds, review volume, services offered, credentials held, and business characteristics.

**Direct Communication**

Contact businesses directly through phone, email, or the platform messaging system. Your contact information remains private until you choose to share it. No lead generation. No intermediary tracking.
