title: "Earning Performance Badges"
description: "How performance badges are earned through consistent, compliant behavior"
---

Performance badges are trust signals that help customers quickly understand a business's track record. They're earned automatically based on observed patterns in reputation and activity — not applied manually, requested, or purchased. Badges reflect consistency over time rather than one-time spikes.

## What Influences Badge Eligibility

Exact thresholds aren't published, but badge eligibility is influenced by several observable factors.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review quality">
    Consistently strong customer feedback matters more than isolated highs or lows. A single negative review doesn't disqualify a business — repeated patterns do.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review consistency">
    Steady review activity over time is more meaningful than short bursts. Consistent monthly reviews signal reliability, while large spikes followed by long gaps signal inconsistency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review authenticity">
    Hometrics monitors for unnatural or non-compliant review patterns. Examples include purchased reviews, reviews from employees or owners, repeated identical language, and sudden volume spikes without ongoing activity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Time and stability">
    Badges are designed to reward businesses that perform well over time. Longevity and stability matter.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Reasons a Badge Hasn't Appeared Yet

If a badge hasn't appeared, it's usually due to one or more of the following:

- Long gaps between reviews
- Inconsistent feedback patterns
- Incomplete or unclaimed profiles
- Low follow-through on requests
- Review activity that appears unnatural

These aren't penalties — they indicate insufficient confidence signals.

## Manual Review Collection vs Automated Collection

The difference between manual and automated review collection is execution consistency. Manual processes depend on remembering each time. Automated processes run without active management.

### Manual Collection

| What it requires | Why it fails |
| :--- | :--- |
| Remember to ask after every transaction | Forgotten during busy periods |
| Send follow-ups manually | Inconsistent timing, easy to skip |
| Track who was asked and when | No system, relies on memory |
| Maintain discipline regardless of workload | Breaks down under pressure |

**Result:** Sporadic review activity. Long gaps. Inconsistent patterns that delay or prevent badge eligibility.

### Automated Collection

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Consistent requests" icon="bolt">
    Sent automatically after each transaction without manual action.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Timed follow-ups" icon="clock">
    Follow-ups occur on schedule if no review is left.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Predictable cadence" icon="chart-line">
    Reviews accumulate steadily instead of in sporadic bursts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitoring built-in" icon="bell">
    Review activity tracked automatically. No spreadsheets.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Result:** Steady review volume. Consistent patterns. Better badge eligibility over time.

### What Automation Changes

Automation doesn't change how badges are earned — it changes how reliably the underlying behavior occurs.

**Badges still require:**
- High ratings
- Authentic reviews
- Sustained performance over time

**Automation provides:**
- Consistent execution without manual effort
- Predictable timing regardless of workload
- Reduced risk of long gaps in activity
