title: "Earning Performance Badges"
description: "How performance badges are earned through consistent, compliant behavior"
---

Performance badges are trust signals that help customers quickly understand a business's track record. They're earned automatically based on observed patterns in reputation and activity, not applied manually, requested, or purchased. Badges reflect consistency over time rather than one-time spikes.

---

## Why Badges Matter

Badges influence customer decisions by reducing uncertainty. When customers compare similar businesses, badges provide quick visual confirmation of sustained quality. Profiles with badges convert at higher rates because they signal proven reliability without requiring customers to read through dozens of reviews.

Badges also improve visibility. Businesses with badges appear more prominently in search results and attract more profile views. This creates a reinforcing cycle: better service leads to consistent reviews, which earn badges, which drive more visibility and customer engagement.

## What Influences Badge Eligibility

Exact thresholds aren't published, but badge eligibility is influenced by several observable factors.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review quality">
    Consistently strong customer feedback matters more than isolated highs or lows. A single negative review doesn't disqualify a business. Repeated patterns do.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review consistency">
    Steady review activity over time is more meaningful than short bursts. Consistent monthly reviews signal reliability, while large spikes followed by long gaps signal inconsistency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review authenticity">
    Hometrics monitors for unnatural or non-compliant review patterns. Examples include purchased reviews, reviews from employees or owners, repeated identical language, and sudden volume spikes without ongoing activity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Time and stability">
    Badges are designed to reward businesses that perform well over time. Longevity and stability matter.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Badges are assigned automatically when these signals align. If a badge hasn't appeared yet, it's usually due to gaps in one or more of these areas.

## Common Reasons a Badge Hasn't Appeared Yet

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Long gaps between reviews" icon="calendar-xmark">
    Months without customer feedback signal inconsistency. Regular review activity demonstrates ongoing customer engagement.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Inconsistent feedback patterns" icon="chart-mixed">
    Large spikes followed by inactivity create uncertainty. Steady volume over time builds confidence.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Low review volume" icon="star-half">
    Insufficient review volume signals limited customer base or low engagement. Customers trust businesses with substantial feedback history.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unnatural review activity" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Sudden spikes, identical language, or other manipulation attempts delay or prevent badge assignment.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
These aren't penalties. They indicate insufficient confidence signals for badge assignment.

The most common issue is inconsistency. Businesses that request reviews manually often experience gaps during busy periods, creating irregular patterns that delay badge eligibility. Automation solves this by maintaining consistent execution regardless of workload.

## Manual Review Collection: The Problem

Manual review collection depends on remembering each step and maintaining discipline over time. This breaks down under normal business conditions.

<Warning>
Manual processes fail because they depend on perfect execution during imperfect conditions.
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Inconsistent execution" icon="circle-xmark">
    Timing varies based on who remembers and when. Review requests get skipped during busy periods, creating long gaps in activity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="QR codes aren't reliable" icon="qrcode">
    Low completion rates and requires customer action in the moment. Most customers don't follow through.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Word of mouth fails" icon="comment-slash">
    People forget to leave reviews even when they intend to. Good intentions don't translate to consistent action.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time-consuming to track" icon="clock">
    Spreadsheets and manual logs require constant maintenance. Who was asked? When? Did they respond? Manual tracking becomes overwhelming.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Result:** Sporadic review activity. Long gaps. Inconsistent patterns that delay or prevent badge eligibility.

## Automated Review Collection: The Solution

Automated systems run without active management. Requests are sent on schedule, follow-ups occur automatically, and review activity becomes predictable.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Consistent requests" icon="bolt">
    Sent automatically after each transaction without manual action required. No one has to remember.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Timed follow-ups" icon="clock">
    Scheduled reminders if no review is left, improving response rates without additional effort.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Predictable review cadence" icon="chart-line">
    Reviews accumulate steadily instead of in sporadic bursts, creating reliable patterns that support badge eligibility.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time savings" icon="gauge-high">
    Zero manual effort required once configured. Set it and maintain consistent review momentum.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Result:** Steady review volume. Consistent patterns. Better badge eligibility over time.
