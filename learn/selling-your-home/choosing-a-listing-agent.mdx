title: "Choosing a Listing Agent"
description: "Finding the right agent to represent your sale"
---

A listing agent represents the seller throughout a real estate transaction. They handle pricing strategy, marketing, showings, offer negotiation, and transaction coordination from listing to closing.

The agent chosen affects how quickly the property sells, what price it achieves, and how smoothly the transaction proceeds.

## What a Listing Agent Does

Listing agents provide services across several phases:

**Pre-listing:** Tour property, recommend repairs or improvements, suggest staging, advise on curb appeal, gather property information and disclosures.

**Marketing preparation:** Arrange professional photography, create property description, prepare marketing materials, set up lockbox and showing system.

**Active marketing:** Enter property in MLS, distribute to real estate websites, schedule and host open houses, coordinate private showings, collect showing feedback, adjust strategy as needed.

**Offer management:** Review offer details with seller, explain terms and contingencies, provide market context, advise on counteroffers, present multiple offers objectively.

**Under contract:** Coordinate buyer's inspection, negotiate inspection items, track contract contingencies, monitor timeline and deadlines, communicate with all parties.

**Closing:** Review closing statement, coordinate final walkthrough, ensure property is in agreed condition, gather keys and access devices.

## How Listing Agents Get Paid

Listing agents typically work on commission, earning payment only when a transaction closes.

**Commission basics:**

- Calculated as a percentage of the sale price
- Paid at closing from sale proceeds
- No sale means no commission
- Amount is negotiable between seller and agent

**What commission covers:**

- Marketing expenses (photography, advertising, signage, virtual tours, staging consultation)
- Agent time and expertise (showings, negotiations, coordination)
- Business overhead (MLS dues, licensing, insurance)
- Broker split (agents share commission with their supervising broker)

Commission rates vary by market. There is no standard or required rate. The agent who nets the highest sale price may not be the one with the lowest commission.

**Communication and availability**

- Who handles day-to-day communication
- Update frequency during listing period
- Evening and weekend availability

**Contract terms**

## Listing Agreement Types

**Exclusive right to sell:** Most common. Agent earns commission regardless of who finds the buyer. Provides maximum agent commitment to marketing.

**Exclusive agency:** Agent earns commission unless the seller finds a buyer without agent assistance. Less common because agents have less incentive to invest in marketing.

**Open listing:** Seller can work with multiple agents. Only the agent who brings the buyer earns commission. Rarely used because agents have minimal incentive to market the property.

Listing agreements typically run 3-6 months. Review cancellation terms before signing.

## Alternatives to Full-Service Agents

**Discount brokerages:** Reduced commission in exchange for limited services. May include MLS listing only, limited marketing, no showing assistance, or minimal negotiation support.

**Flat-fee MLS listing:** Pay a flat fee to list on the MLS without full agent representation. Seller handles showings, negotiations, and transaction coordination.

**For Sale By Owner (FSBO):** Sell without agent representation. Seller handles all marketing, showings, negotiations, and paperwork.

These alternatives involve tradeoffs between cost savings and service level. They work best for experienced sellers in high-demand markets with straightforward properties.
