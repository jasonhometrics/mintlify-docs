A real estate appraiser is a licensed professional who provides an independent opinion of a property's market value. Appraisals are required for most mortgage transactions and serve various other purposes including tax appeals, estate settlement, and divorce proceedings.

Appraisers must be licensed or certified by their state and follow Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP).

## Why Appraisals Matter

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Lender requirement">
    Mortgage lenders require appraisals to confirm the property is worth at least the loan amount. The property serves as collateral for the loan.

    If the appraisal comes in low, the lender may not approve the full loan amount requested.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Buyer protection">
    Appraisals help buyers avoid overpaying for a property. An independent valuation provides objective confirmation that the purchase price is reasonable for the market.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transaction requirement">
    Beyond purchases, appraisals may be required for:

    - Refinancing
    - Home equity loans
    - PMI removal
    - Estate settlement
    - Divorce proceedings
    - Property tax appeals
    - Bankruptcy filings
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How Appraisers Determine Value

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sales comparison approach">
    Most common method for residential properties. The appraiser identifies recently sold properties similar to the subject property and adjusts for differences.

    Adjustments account for differences in size, features, condition, location, and sale date.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cost approach">
    Estimates what it would cost to replace the property. Calculates land value plus construction cost minus depreciation.

    Often used for new construction or unique properties with few comparables.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Income approach">
    Used for investment properties. Calculates value based on the income the property generates.

    Considers rental income, operating expenses, and capitalization rates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
