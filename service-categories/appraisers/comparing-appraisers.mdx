When ordering an appraisal outside of a mortgage transaction, property owners can select their own appraiser. For mortgage transactions, lenders use Appraisal Management Companies (AMCs) to assign appraisers, and borrowers cannot choose.

Understanding what makes a qualified appraiser helps set expectations regardless of who selects the appraiser.

## When You Can Choose

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Situations where you select">
    Property owners can choose their own appraiser for:

    - Pre-listing appraisals
    - Estate appraisals
    - Divorce appraisals
    - Tax appeal appraisals
    - PMI removal (sometimes)
    - Private transactions (cash sales)
    - Bankruptcy proceedings
    - Insurance purposes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Situations where lender selects">
    Federal regulations require appraiser independence for mortgage transactions:

    - Purchase with financing
    - Refinance
    - Home equity loans/lines

    Borrowers pay but cannot choose. Designed to prevent valuation manipulation.
  </Accordion>

## What to Look For
