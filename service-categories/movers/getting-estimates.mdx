Moving estimates determine what you'll pay. How estimates are calculated and what type of estimate you receive significantly affects your final cost and protection against price increases.

Understanding estimate types helps consumers avoid surprises and choose appropriate protection.

## Types of Estimates

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Binding estimate">
    Guaranteed price that cannot increase unless you add services or items.

    **How it works:**

    - Mover assesses belongings
    - Provides written estimate
    - You pay that amount at delivery
    - Price cannot increase even if shipment weighs more

    **Protection:** Maximum protection against price increases.

    **Risk:** If estimate is low, mover absorbs the loss (so they tend to estimate higher).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Binding not-to-exceed estimate">
    Guaranteed maximum price, but you may pay less if shipment weighs less.

    **How it works:**

    - Mover provides estimate
    - You pay actual weight/charges OR estimate, whichever is lower
    - Never pay more than estimate

    **Protection:** Best protection. You benefit if estimate was high.

    **Availability:** Not all movers offer this option.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Non-binding estimate">
    Approximate cost based on estimated weight and services. Actual cost determined after weighing shipment.

    **How it works:**

    - Mover estimates weight and provides approximate cost
    - Truck weighed before and after loading
    - You pay based on actual weight

    **Protection:** Limited. Final cost can exceed estimate.

    **Important:** At delivery, you can only be required to pay 110% of estimate. Remaining balance due within 30 days.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Non-binding estimates can increase significantly on moving day. If a mover provides a non-binding estimate that seems too low, the final cost may be much higher. Request binding estimates when possible.
</Warning>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What Affects Estimates

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Weight/volume">
    Primary cost driver for long-distance moves.

    **Average weights:**

    - Studio apartment: 1,500 to 2,500 lbs
    - 1 bedroom: 2,500 to 3,500 lbs
    - 2 bedroom: 5,000 to 6,000 lbs
    - 3 bedroom: 7,000 to 10,000 lbs
    - 4+ bedroom: 10,000 to 15,000+ lbs

    Books, equipment, and dense items weigh more than they appear.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Distance">
    Direct factor in long-distance pricing.

    Cost per mile decreases as distance increases (fixed costs spread over more miles). But total cost still increases with distance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Services selected">
    Each added service increases cost:

    - Full packing: Adds 25-40% to base cost
    - Partial packing: Per room or per item
    - Unpacking: Similar to packing costs
    - Crating: Special items individually priced
    - Appliance service: \$100 to \$300 per appliance
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Access challenges">
    Difficulty at origin or destination adds cost:

    - **Stairs:** \$50 to \$100 per flight
    - **Long carry:** 75+ feet from truck to door
    - **Elevator:** Sometimes charged if slow or small
    - **Narrow doorways:** May require disassembly
    - **No parking:** May need shuttle truck
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Special items">
    Items requiring extra handling:

    - Piano: \$200 to \$1,000+
    - Pool table: \$300 to \$600+
    - Safe: \$200 to \$500+
    - Hot tub: \$300 to \$1,000+
    - Exercise equipment: \$50 to \$200+
    - Artwork/antiques: Custom pricing
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Timing">
    When you move affects price:

    - **Peak season (summer):** 20-30% higher
    - **End of month:** More expensive
    - **Weekends:** May cost more
    - **Holidays:** Limited availability, higher cost

    Moving mid-month, mid-week, in off-season saves money.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Getting Multiple Estimates

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many to get">
    Get at least 3 estimates from different companies.

    **Why multiple estimates:**

    - Price varies significantly between companies
    - Compare services and professionalism
    - Identify outliers (too high or suspiciously low)
    - Learn about the process
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Making estimates comparable">
    Ensure each estimate covers same services:

    - Same origin and destination
    - Same items being moved
    - Same services (packing, unpacking)
    - Same valuation coverage
    - Same delivery window

    Apples-to-apples comparison prevents surprises.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reading the estimate">
    Review estimates carefully:

    - **Services included:** What's covered
    - **Services excluded:** What costs extra
    - **Estimate type:** Binding vs non-binding
    - **Valuation:** Coverage included
    - **Payment terms:** Deposit, balance due
    - **Cancellation policy:** Fees, deadlines
    - **Delivery window:** When to expect items
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Questions to ask">
    During estimate process:

    - Is this binding or non-binding?
    - What's included in this price?
    - What additional charges might apply?
    - What's your claim rate?
    - Who will actually perform the move?
    - Can I get references?
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  The lowest estimate isn't always the best value. Extremely low estimates often increase on moving day. Look for reasonable pricing from reputable companies with good reviews.
</Note>

## Red Flags in Estimates

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Significantly lower than others">
    If one estimate is 30-50% below others, be cautious.

    **Possible explanations:**

    - Lowball estimate that will increase
    - Missing services or fees
    - Inexperienced or unqualified company
    - Potential scam

    Ask why their price is so different.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Large deposit required">
    Reputable movers require minimal or no deposit for local moves. Long-distance deposits vary but shouldn't exceed 20-30%.

    **Red flag:** Large upfront payment demanded, especially cash only.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No in-home or virtual survey">
    For significant moves, refusing to assess belongings suggests:

    - Estimate is a guess
    - Price will increase later
    - Company may not be professional
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Won't provide written estimate">
    All estimates should be in writing with:

    - Company name and contact
    - USDOT number (interstate)
    - Itemized services and costs
    - Estimate type (binding/non-binding)
    - Signature

    Verbal estimates have no protection.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pressure to sign immediately">
    Legitimate companies allow time to decide.

    High-pressure tactics suggest:

    - Fear of comparison shopping
    - Hidden costs
    - Questionable practices
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Inventory Lists

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What they are">
    Detailed list of all items being moved. Forms basis for estimate and serves as record of shipment contents.

    Interstate movers must provide inventory at pickup.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Creating your own">
    Before estimates, create inventory:

    - Walk through each room
    - List major items
    - Note boxes (actual or estimated)
    - Flag special items
    - Include garage, basement, attic
    - Note items not being moved

    Detailed inventory leads to accurate estimates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reviewing mover's inventory">
    At pickup, mover creates official inventory noting:

    - Item number
    - Description
    - Condition at pickup (existing damage)

    **Review carefully:**

    - Verify all items listed
    - Check condition notes accuracy
    - Note disagreements before signing
    - Keep your copy

    Inventory is key document for claims.
