## Maintaining Badges

Businesses must maintain qualifying performance standards to keep badges. Badges are removed if performance declines, review patterns change significantly, or if review activity becomes inconsistent.

<Warning>
  Hometrics monitors review patterns to detect manipulation attempts. Businesses attempting to gain an unfair advantage through fraudulent practices will have their badges removed and may face suspension from our platform.
</Warning>
