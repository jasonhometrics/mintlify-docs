description: "The first-time home buyer journey from pre-approval through closing day"
---

Buying a home involves multiple professionals, tight deadlines, and significant financial commitments. Most first-time buyers don't realize how fast the process moves once an offer is accepted. Understanding the timeline and knowing who to hire before you need them prevents costly mistakes.

## Timeline at a Glance

Most transactions close 30-45 days after a purchase contract is signed. That sounds like enough time until you realize what has to happen within those weeks.

| Milestone | Typical Timing |
|-----------|----------------|
| Earnest money due | 3 business days after contract |
| Inspection contingency expires | 7-14 days after contract |
| Appraisal completed | 7-14 days after contract |
| Financing contingency expires | 21-30 days after contract |
| Closing Disclosure received | 3 days before closing |
| Final walkthrough | 24-48 hours before closing |
| Closing day | 30-45 days after contract |

Once you're under contract, deadlines stack up quickly. Miss the earnest money deadline and you're in breach of contract. Miss the inspection contingency and you lose negotiating power. The only way to stay in control is to prepare before the clock starts.

## When to Research Each Vendor

Most buyers wait until they need a vendor to start researching. By then, it's too late to make an informed decision.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Lender: Before you start shopping">
    Get pre-approved before touring homes. A verified pre-approval protects your earnest money and tells you what you can actually afford. Research and compare at least three lenders.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent: Before you tour homes">
    Your agent represents your interests in the largest financial transaction of your life. Interview multiple agents before signing a buyer agreement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Title Company: Before you write an offer">
    You have 3 days to wire earnest money once your offer is accepted. That's not enough time to compare options, verify security protocols, and confirm wire fraud insurance. Research title companies before you need one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Home Inspector: Before you're under contract">
    Inspection contingencies are typically 7-14 days. Have an inspector identified so you can schedule immediately after your offer is accepted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insurance: 30-45 days before closing">
    Your lender requires proof of homeowners insurance before funding your loan. Starting early gives you time to compare quotes and avoid overpaying for inadequate coverage.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
The biggest mistake first-time buyers make is accepting vendor referrals without doing their own research. Your agent will recommend a lender. Your lender will suggest a title company. These may be excellent professionals, but the only way to know is to verify their track record yourself. [RESPA](/service-categories/legal/consumer-protections/respa) protects your right to choose your own providers.
</Warning>

## Common First-Time Buyer Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
 <Accordion title="Weak pre-approval">
    A 15-minute phone call with no documentation is a [pre-qualification, not a pre-approval](/service-categories/mortgage-lenders/pre-approval). If your lender hasn't verified your income, assets, and debt, problems will surface after you've signed a contract and deposited earnest money.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Skipping title company research">
    Most buyers use whoever their agent recommends without asking a single question. Title companies handle your [earnest money](/service-categories/title-escrow/earnest-money) and protect you from [wire fraud](/service-categories/title-escrow/wire-fraud-protection). The wrong choice can cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.
  </Accordion>
  
 <Accordion title="Waiving contingencies without understanding the risk">
    In competitive markets, buyers feel pressure to waive inspection or financing [contingencies](/service-categories/legal/contracts-and-agreements/addendums-and-contingencies). Waiving these protections means your earnest money is at risk if problems arise. Know exactly what you're giving up before you waive.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Making major financial changes after pre-approval">
    Opening new credit cards, buying a car, changing jobs, or moving money between accounts can affect your loan qualification. Avoid major financial changes until after closing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Treating insurance as a last-minute checkbox">
    Scrambling for insurance a week before closing leads to overpaying for policies that don't actually cover what you need. Start researching insurance providers early.
