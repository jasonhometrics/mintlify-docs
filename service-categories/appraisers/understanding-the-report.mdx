## Reading the Comparable Grid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How adjustments work">
    Adjustments modify comparable sale prices to account for differences from subject property.

    **Adjustment direction:**

    - If comparable is BETTER than subject: Negative adjustment (subtract from comp price)
    - If comparable is WORSE than subject: Positive adjustment (add to comp price)

    Goal is to estimate what each comparable would have sold for if it were identical to subject.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Common adjustment categories">
    Typical adjustments include:

    | Category        | Typical Range                |
    | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | Location        | \$5,000 - \$50,000+          |
    | Site/lot size   | \$1,000 - \$20,000           |
    | Quality         | \$5,000 - \$30,000           |
    | Age             | \$1,000 - \$15,000           |
    | Condition       | \$5,000 - \$30,000           |
    | GLA (per sq ft) | \$30 - \$100 per sq ft       |
    | Basement finish | \$10 - \$50 per sq ft        |
    | Garage          | \$3,000 - \$15,000 per space |
    | Bathrooms       | \$3,000 - \$10,000           |
    | Fireplace       | \$1,000 - \$5,000            |
    | Pool            | \$5,000 - \$25,000           |

    Adjustment amounts vary by market.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Net vs gross adjustments">
    **Net adjustment:** Sum of all adjustments (positives and negatives combined)

    **Gross adjustment:** Sum of absolute values (all adjustments added regardless of direction)

    **Guidelines:**

    - Net adjustment over 15% raises questions
    - Gross adjustment over 25% suggests weak comparable
    - Individual adjustment over 10% needs support

    Large adjustments indicate comparable may not be ideal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Adjusted sale price">
    After all adjustments, each comparable has an adjusted sale price.

    **Example:**

    - Comparable sold for \$350,000
    - Adjustments total +\$15,000
    - Adjusted sale price: \$365,000

    Appraiser considers range of adjusted prices to develop value conclusion.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  The comparable requiring the fewest adjustments is typically given most weight. A comparable with minimal adjustments is more reliable than one requiring extensive modification.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Photos">
    Check that photos accurately represent:

    - Current condition
    - Updates and features
