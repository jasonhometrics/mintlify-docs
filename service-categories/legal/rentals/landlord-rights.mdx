Landlords have specific legal rights related to their rental properties. These rights are balanced against tenant protections and must be exercised according to applicable law.

Understanding landlord rights helps property owners manage rentals effectively while avoiding legal pitfalls.

## Core Rights

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Collect Rent">
    Landlords can collect rent on the due date, charge reasonable late fees (if in lease), require specific payment methods, and pursue legal remedies for non-payment.
    
    **Limitations:** Cannot charge excessive late fees, harass tenants for payment, or skip legal eviction process for non-payment.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Access Property">
    Landlords can enter for repairs, inspections, showing to prospective tenants, and emergencies.
    
    **Requirements:** Provide advance notice (typically 24-48 hours), enter at reasonable times, and have legitimate purpose. Repeated entry without valid reason may constitute harassment.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set and Enforce Rules">
    Landlords can establish reasonable rules for noise, parking, pets, smoking, guests, and common areas.
    
    **Requirements:** Rules must be reasonable, apply equally to all tenants, be provided in writing, and not violate fair housing laws. Enforcement options include warnings, fines (if lease permits), cure notices, and eviction for serious violations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Screen Tenants">
    Landlords can evaluate credit history, income, rental history, criminal background (with limitations), and employment.
    
    **Limitations:** Cannot discriminate based on protected classes, must follow Fair Credit Reporting Act, and must apply criteria consistently. Some jurisdictions restrict criminal background screening.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Collect Security Deposits">
    Landlords can collect deposits, hold them for the lease term, and deduct for unpaid rent, damages beyond normal wear, and cleaning if needed.
    
    **Limitations:** State limits on amounts (typically 1-2 months), specific holding requirements, itemization required, and return deadlines (typically 14-30 days).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Terminate Tenancy">
    Landlords can end tenancies for non-payment, lease violations, illegal activity, or lease expiration (unless just-cause jurisdiction).
    
    **Requirements:** Must follow legal process—provide proper notice, allow cure period if required, file with court, obtain judgment, and use sheriff for removal if necessary. Self-help eviction is illegal.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Pursue Damages">
    Landlords can seek compensation for unpaid rent, property damage, cleaning costs, re-renting costs, and attorney fees (if lease provides).
    
    **Options:** Deduct from deposit, small claims court, civil court, collections, or credit reporting. Must mitigate damages by trying to re-rent promptly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sell Property">
    Landlords can sell rental property during active tenancies. Leases transfer to new owner. Month-to-month can be terminated with proper notice; fixed-term must be honored.
    
    Must provide proper notice for showings and cannot excessively disrupt tenants.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Prohibited Actions

<Warning>
**Landlords cannot:**

- Enter without proper notice (except emergencies)
- Change locks or shut off utilities to force tenant out
- Remove tenant belongings without court order
- Retaliate against tenants exercising legal rights
- Discriminate based on protected classes
- Selectively enforce rules against specific tenants
- Charge excessive or illegal fees
</Warning>

## When Rights Are Violated

If tenants violate landlord rights:

1. **Document** the violation with photos, dates, and written records
2. **Provide written notice** specifying the issue
3. **Allow cure period** if required by law or lease
4. **Follow legal procedures** for escalation
5. **Consult an attorney** before eviction or when situations are complex

<Note>
Never resort to self-help remedies. Even when tenants clearly violate lease terms, landlords must follow legal processes. Improper actions expose landlords to liability exceeding the original problem.
