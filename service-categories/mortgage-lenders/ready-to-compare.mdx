title: "Comparing Lenders"
description: "Questions to ask and how to evaluate mortgage lender options"
---

Comparing mortgage lenders means evaluating experience, communication, fees, and service before selecting one for a transaction. The lender chosen affects more than interest rates. They determine pre-approval strength, closing reliability, and how problems are handled.

Interviewing at least three lenders ensures proper comparison and negotiating leverage.

## What to Compare

**Experience and track record**
Lenders closing 10+ loans monthly have exposure to complex scenarios. They recognize problems before they escalate and know how to resolve issues that arise.

**Communication and availability**
Real estate transactions require responsiveness outside business hours. Availability during evenings and weekends matters when deadlines are tight.

**Local relationships**
Lenders embedded in local markets have ties to real estate agents, title companies, and appraisers. These relationships facilitate smoother transactions.

**Fees and costs**
Rates and fees vary significantly between lenders. Comparing Loan Estimates reveals true cost differences.

**Problem-solving ability**
When appraisals come in low or documentation issues arise, experienced lenders have strategies for resolution.

## Essential Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Experience">
    **"How many loans do you close per month?"**
    
    Lenders closing 5-10+ loans monthly have seen various scenarios. Lower volume may indicate limited experience with complex situations.
    
    **"How long have you been lending in this market?"**
    
    Local experience matters. Familiarity with area property values, appraisers, and title companies prevents delays.
    
    **"What's your on-time closing rate?"**
    
    Rates above 95% indicate reliable processes. Ask what causes the closings that don't happen on time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Communication">
    **"Who will be my main contact throughout the process?"**
    
    Some lenders hand off to processors after application. Others stay involved throughout. Clarify expectations upfront.
    
    **"Are you available evenings and weekends?"**
    
    Offer deadlines and urgent requests occur outside business hours. Limited availability creates risk during time-sensitive situations.
    
    **"How do you keep clients updated?"**
    
    Weekly updates and proactive communication prevent surprises. Ask how they handle notification when issues arise.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Local Knowledge">
    **"Do you work with local real estate agents and title companies?"**
    
    Established relationships facilitate communication and can strengthen financing credibility.
    
    **"Are you familiar with local assistance programs?"**
    
    Down payment assistance, first-time buyer programs, and grants vary by location. Local lenders know available options.
    
    **"How many transactions have you closed in this area?"**
    
    Geographic concentration indicates market familiarity.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Fees and Costs">
    **"Can you provide a detailed fee breakdown?"**
    
    Request itemization including:
    - Origination fee
    - Processing fee
    - Underwriting fee
    - Application fee
    - Any additional charges
    
    **"Which fees are negotiable?"**
    
    Some lenders reduce or waive fees. Understanding negotiability provides leverage.
    
    **"Can you provide a Loan Estimate for my scenario?"**
    
    Loan Estimates allow direct comparison of rates, fees, and total costs between lenders.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Pre-Approval Process">
    **"What documentation do you need for pre-approval?"**
    
    Proper pre-approvals require W-2s, tax returns, pay stubs, and bank statements. Quick approvals without documentation are pre-qualifications.
    
    **"How long does pre-approval take?"**
    
    1-3 business days is standard with complete documentation.
    
    **"How do you handle complex income situations?"**
    
    Self-employment, commission income, or multiple income sources require additional analysis. Ask how they approach these scenarios.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Problem Resolution">
    **"What happens if the appraisal comes in low?"**
    
    Experienced lenders have strategies: dispute processes, comparable sales research, or guidance on renegotiation.
    
    **"Can you share an example of a difficult transaction you closed?"**
    
    Answers reveal problem-solving ability and experience with challenging situations.
    
    **"What would cause a loan to be denied after pre-approval?"**
    
    Understanding risk factors helps avoid problems during the process.

## Red Flags vs Green Flags

<Warning>
**Red Flags:**

- Issues pre-approval in minutes without documentation
- Focuses only on rate, ignores service and communication
- Unavailable outside business hours
- Vague answers about experience or process
- Poor responsiveness during initial contact
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Green Flags:**

- Asks detailed questions about financial situation and goals
- Explains process and timeline clearly
- Provides cell phone and responds evenings/weekends
- Has established relationships with local real estate professionals
- Offers multiple loan options with clear comparisons
</Tip>

## Comparison Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify three lenders to interview">
    Consider local banks, credit unions, and mortgage companies. Ask real estate agents for referrals but evaluate independently.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Schedule consultations">
    Request 20-30 minute calls or meetings. Prepare questions in advance.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Ask identical questions to each">
    Consistent questions enable direct comparison. Document answers for review.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Request Loan Estimates">
    Provide identical information (loan amount, down payment, credit estimate) to each lender. Compare rates, fees, and total costs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Evaluate responsiveness">
    How quickly did they respond to your initial inquiry? Communication patterns during the sales process indicate future service levels.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check reviews and references">
    Read reviews focusing on communication and closing experience. Request references from recent transactions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Comparing Loan Estimates

Loan Estimates are standardized documents that allow direct comparison between lenders. Key sections to compare:

**Loan Terms (Page 1)**
- Interest rate
- Monthly principal and interest
- Whether rate is locked

**Projected Payments (Page 1)**
- Total monthly payment including taxes and insurance
- Mortgage insurance amount and duration

**Costs at Closing (Page 2)**
- Origination charges (lender fees)
- Services borrower can shop for
- Services borrower cannot shop for
- Total closing costs

**Comparisons (Page 3)**
- Total paid over 5 years
- Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
- Total interest percentage

<Note>
Request Loan Estimates based on identical scenarios from each lender. Different assumptions about taxes, insurance, or loan terms make comparison difficult.
</Note>

## Beyond the Rate

Interest rate is one factor. Other considerations affect total cost and experience:

**Closing costs**
Lower rates sometimes come with higher fees. Compare total costs, not just rates.

**Lender credits vs points**
Lenders may offer credits (reducing closing costs) or charge points (upfront interest). Understand how these affect your specific situation.

**Service and communication**
A slightly higher rate with responsive local service may cost less than a lower rate with poor execution that delays closing.

**Rate lock terms**
How long is the rate locked? What happens if closing is delayed? What does extending a lock cost?

**On-time closing reliability**
Delays cost money. Rate lock extensions, per diem charges, and rescheduling all have costs.

## Making the Decision

After gathering information:

- Compare Loan Estimates side by side
- Consider total costs, not just monthly payment
- Weigh rate differences against service quality
- Factor in local relationships and availability
- Trust observations about communication and responsiveness

The lowest rate doesn't always mean the best deal. A lender who closes on time, communicates clearly, and solves problems efficiently often provides more value than small rate differences.
