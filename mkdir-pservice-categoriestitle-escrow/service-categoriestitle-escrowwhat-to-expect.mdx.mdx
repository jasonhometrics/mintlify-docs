# What to Expect

## Timeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Day 1-3: Wire Earnest Money">
    Once your offer is accepted, you typically have 3 business days to wire your earnest money deposit to the title company's escrow account.
    
    **Critical:** Verify wiring instructions by phone before sending funds. Never trust emailed instructions without independent verification.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Day 3-7: Title Search Begins">
    Title company examines public records: ownership history, liens, judgments, tax status, easements, and any claims against the property.
    
    They're looking for anything that could prevent clear transfer of ownership.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Day 7-14: Title Report Issued">
    You receive preliminary title report showing what they found: current owner, existing liens that must be paid off, easements, and any title defects.
    
    **Your job:** Review this carefully. Question anything you don't understand.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Day 14-30: Issue Resolution">
    If title problems exist (unpaid liens, boundary disputes, ownership questions), seller must resolve them before closing. This is where delays happen.
    
    Title company coordinates resolution but can't force compliance.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Day 25-30: Closing Coordination">
    Title company prepares all closing documents, coordinates with your lender, schedules closing appointment, and provides final settlement statement.
    
    You receive Closing Disclosure 3 business days before closing—review every line item.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Day 30-45: Closing Day">
    You meet with settlement agent, sign all documents, wire your down payment (verified by phone), and receive keys once deed is recorded.
    
    Entire closing appointment: 30-90 minutes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Post-Closing: Recording & Insurance">
    Title company records deed with county, pays off seller's existing mortgage, distributes funds to all parties, and issues your title insurance policy.
    
    You receive recorded deed and insurance policy within 30-60 days.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Costs

<Note>
These are title company fees only. Your total closing costs include lender fees, government fees, prepaid expenses, and escrow reserves.
</Note>

### Typical Title Company Fees

  <Tab title="Title Search">
    **$200-$400**
    
    Research fee for examining public records and creating title report. Non-refundable even if deal doesn't close.

    Required by lender, protects their interest in the property. Example: $300K loan = $1,500-$3,000.
    
    One-time premium paid at closing.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Title Insurance (Owner's Policy)">
    **$500-$1,500 additional**
    
    Optional but recommended. Protects your ownership interest. Significantly cheaper when purchased simultaneously with lender's policy.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Settlement Fee">
    **$300-$600**
    
    Covers closing coordination, document preparation, and settlement agent's time. Some companies include this in title insurance premium.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Recording Fees">
    **$200-$500**
    
    Government charges to record deed and mortgage in public records. Varies by county. Title company collects and pays on your behalf.

```
Title search: $300
Lender's title insurance: $1,750
Owner's title insurance: $800

Recording fees: $350
─────────────────────────
Total: $3,650
```

**Range:** $2,500-$5,000 depending on location, property value, and loan amount.

<Tip>
Get itemized fee quotes from multiple title companies. Some bundle fees differently, making direct comparison difficult unless you see line-by-line breakdown.
</Tip>

## The Process

### Your Responsibilities

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Wire Earnest Money (Days 1-3)" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    **What you do:** Verify wiring instructions by calling title company using number from their website or your contract (never from email). Wire funds same day.
    
    **What happens:** Title company confirms receipt, deposits funds in escrow account. You receive written confirmation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review Title Report (Day 10-14)" icon="file-magnifying-glass">
    **What you do:** Read preliminary title report. Understand what liens must be paid off, what easements exist, any issues that could affect your ownership.
    
    **What happens:** Your agent or attorney explains anything unclear. If major issues surface, you can renegotiate or walk away under inspection contingency.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review Closing Disclosure (3 Days Before)" icon="file-invoice-dollar">
    **What you do:** Compare Closing Disclosure to Loan Estimate. Verify all numbers match expectations. Question any surprises.
    
    **What happens:** Title company or lender addresses your concerns. Don't sign if numbers are wrong—you have the right to delay closing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Attend Closing (Day 30-45)" icon="signature">
    **What you do:** Bring government ID. Sign documents as settlement agent explains each one. Wire down payment (verified by phone). Ask questions about anything unclear.

## Common Scenarios

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Title Issues Delay Closing" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Problem:** Title search reveals unpaid contractor lien or ownership dispute
    
    **Impact:** Closing delayed 7-30 days while seller resolves
    
    **Protection:** Your earnest money stays in escrow. Contract typically allows deadline extension for title issues.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Cash to Close Changes" icon="arrow-trend-up">
    **Problem:** Final numbers differ from initial estimate due to prorated taxes, HOA fees, or other adjustments
    
    **Impact:** You need to wire more (or less) than expected
    
    **Protection:** Closing Disclosure provided 3 days early so you can prepare. Don't sign if numbers are way off without explanation.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Recording Delays" icon="clock">
    **Problem:** County recording office is backlogged
    
    **Impact:** You might not get keys immediately after signing
    
    **Protection:** Most contracts address this—you typically get keys once deed is submitted for recording, not after it's actually recorded.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Wire Fraud Attempt" icon="shield-exclamation">
    **Problem:** You receive email with "updated wiring instructions"
    
    **Impact:** If you wire without verifying, funds go to scammers
