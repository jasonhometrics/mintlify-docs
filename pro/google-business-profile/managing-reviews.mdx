title: "Managing Reviews"
description: "Encouraging reviews and responding to customer feedback"
---

Reviews influence both search rankings and consumer decisions. Google considers review quantity, quality, and recency as [prominence signals](/pro/local-search/overview#prominence) for local search rankings. Consumers rely on reviews to evaluate businesses before making contact.

Effective review management includes encouraging satisfied clients to leave reviews, responding appropriately to all feedback, and addressing problematic reviews through proper channels.

## Why Reviews Matter

Reviews affect local search visibility and business outcomes:

### Review Signals Google Considers

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Quantity | Total number of reviews on the listing |
| Rating | Average star rating |
| Recency | How recently reviews were left |
| Velocity | Rate of new reviews over time |
| Content | Keywords and topics mentioned in review text |
| Responses | Whether the business responds to reviews |

<Info>
A steady stream of reviews over time is better than a burst of reviews followed by silence. Recency and velocity matter alongside total quantity.
</Info>

## Encouraging Reviews

Most satisfied clients will leave reviews if asked. The challenge is asking consistently and making the process easy.

### When to Ask

- After successful transaction completion
- Following positive feedback or compliments
- When the client expresses satisfaction
- At natural relationship milestones

### How to Ask

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Direct Request">
    Simply ask satisfied clients if they would be willing to share their experience on Google. Personal requests have higher conversion rates than automated ones.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Email Follow-Up">
    Send a thank-you email after transaction completion that includes a direct link to leave a review. Keep the message brief and personal.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review Link">
    Google provides a short URL for review requests. Find it in the GBP dashboard under "Ask for reviews." Share this link in communications.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="QR Code">
    Create a QR code linking to the review page. Include on printed materials, business cards, or closing documents.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Google's guidelines prohibit offering incentives for reviews, selectively soliciting reviews from happy customers only, and discouraging negative reviews. Reviews must be unbiased and honest.
</Warning>

### Making Reviews Easy

Reduce friction in the review process:

- Provide a direct link (not just "find us on Google")
- Send the link via text message for mobile convenience
- Include brief instructions if the client seems unfamiliar with the process
- Follow up once if no review appears, but do not pressure

<Tip>
Create a short URL using Google's review link generator. The direct link skips search steps and opens directly to the review form.
</Tip>

## Responding to Reviews

Responses show engagement and affect how potential clients perceive the business. Respond to all reviews, not just negative ones.

### Responding to Positive Reviews

- Thank the reviewer by name
- Be specific about the work or interaction
- Keep the response concise
- Avoid excessive marketing language

**Example Response:**
```
Thank you, Sarah! It was a pleasure helping you and Michael 
through your first home purchase. We appreciate you taking 
the time to share your experience.
```

### Responding to Negative Reviews

Negative reviews require more careful handling:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pause before responding">
    Do not respond immediately when upset. Wait until able to respond professionally.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Acknowledge the concern">
    Show that the feedback was heard, even if disagreeing with the characterization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Offer to resolve offline">
    Provide contact information to discuss further rather than debating publicly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keep it brief">
    Long defensive responses often make the situation worse. Stay concise.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remain professional">
    Future clients will read this response. Demonstrate how the business handles problems.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example Response:**
```
We're sorry to hear about your experience. This doesn't reflect 
the service we aim to provide. Please contact us at 
[phone/email] so we can discuss this further and make it right.
```

<Info>
Potential clients often read negative reviews specifically to see how the business responds. A professional, empathetic response can neutralize the impact of a negative review.
</Info>

## Handling Fake or Policy-Violating Reviews

Some reviews violate Google's policies and can be reported for removal.

### Reviews That Violate Policy

- Reviews from people who were not actual customers
- Reviews meant for a different business
- Reviews containing spam or promotional content
- Reviews with offensive or inappropriate content
- Reviews from competitors or former employees with conflicts of interest
- Multiple reviews from the same person

### Reporting Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Flag the review">
    Find the review in the GBP dashboard or on Google Maps. Click the three-dot menu and select "Flag as inappropriate."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select violation type">
    Choose the category that best describes the policy violation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for review">
    Google reviews flagged content. This can take days to weeks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Escalate if needed">
    If the review remains after flagging, use Google Business Profile support for further appeal.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Google does not remove reviews simply because they are negative or because the business disagrees with them. Only reviews that violate specific policies are eligible for removal.
</Warning>

### While Waiting for Removal

- Respond professionally to the review as if it were legitimate
- Do not mention that the review has been reported
- Continue focusing on generating new genuine reviews

## Review Monitoring

Set up systems to catch new reviews quickly:

- Enable GBP notifications for new reviews
- Check the GBP dashboard regularly
- Use monitoring tools that alert to new reviews across platforms
- Aim to respond within 24-48 hours

### Response Timeframe Goals

| Review Type | Response Target |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Negative | Within 24 hours |
| Neutral | Within 48 hours |
| Positive | Within 1 week |

<Check>
Responding promptly to negative reviews shows responsiveness. Responding to positive reviews encourages future reviews from others who see the engagement.
</Check>

## Reviews and Hometrics
