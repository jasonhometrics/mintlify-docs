Most local businesses don’t realize it, but your Google Business Profile (GBP) is usually the first impression people get of your business — not your website, not your storefront, not even your social media.

If your profile is outdated or incomplete, you’re losing trust, leads, and visibility. It’s that simple.

## What is a Google Business Profile?

A Google Business Profile is your public listing on Google Search and Maps. It shows your business name, hours, location, services, reviews, photos, and more. It’s how Google introduces you to the world — and how customers decide if you’re worth contacting.

## Why it matters now

  <Accordion title="It shows up first">
    When someone searches for your business (or services like yours), Google usually shows your Business Profile before your website. On mobile, it may take up the entire screen.

  <Accordion title="It feeds AI and voice search">
    Search engines and voice assistants pull info from your profile — not just your website. Inaccurate or missing details can cost you ranking and relevance.

  <Accordion title="Customers judge you by it">
    People look at your reviews, photos, and updates to decide if you’re legit. A neglected profile makes you look unprofessional or out of business.

<Note>
If your Google Business Profile is wrong, you may never get the chance to explain. Customers will just move on.
