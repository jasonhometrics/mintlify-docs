title: "Getting Pre-Approved"
description: "Why mortgage pre-approval comes first and what separates real verification from marketing gimmicks"
---

Pre-approval is the first step in the home buying process because it determines what you can actually afford and protects your earnest money once you're under contract. Getting this wrong can cost you thousands of dollars and kill deals after you've already committed.

## Why Pre-Approval Comes First

**Protects your earnest money**

Once your offer is accepted, [earnest money](/service-categories/title-escrow/earnest-money) (typically 1-3% of purchase price) is due within 3 business days. If financing falls through later because of issues that should have been caught earlier, your deposit may be at risk.

**Sets realistic expectations**

Verified pre-approval reveals actual purchasing power based on documented income and assets. This prevents wasted time viewing properties outside your actual price range.

**Strengthens your offer**

Sellers and listing agents recognize the difference between a quick phone call and verified documentation. In competitive situations, strong pre-approval signals that financing is likely to close.

**Speeds the process**

Much of the documentation work happens upfront during pre-approval. Once you're under contract, the lender can move faster because verification is already complete.

## Pre-Qualification vs Pre-Approval

These terms are used interchangeably, but they represent very different levels of verification.

|                      | Pre-Qualification        | Pre-Approval                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Based on**         | What you tell the lender | Verified documentation           |
| **Documentation**    | None required            | Income, assets, credit confirmed |
| **Commitment level** | Estimate only            | Written commitment from lender   |
| **Time to complete** | Minutes                  | 1-3 business days                |
| **Value in offers**  | Limited                  | Significantly strengthens offer  |

<Warning>
  If you get "pre-approved" in 10-15 minutes with no documentation, it's not a real pre-approval. It's a marketing tool designed to make you feel ready so you'll start shopping. Ask your lender: "Is this a pre-qualification or a pre-approval? What documentation did you verify?"

## Documentation Required

Pre-approval requires proof of income, assets, and financial history.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Income verification">
    **W-2 employees:**

    - W-2s from past two years
    - Recent pay stubs (typically 30 days)
    - Employment verification

    **Self-employed:**

    - Tax returns from past two years (personal and business)
    - Profit and loss statements
    - Business license or documentation

    **Other income:**

    - Social Security award letters
    - Pension statements
    - Rental income documentation
    - Alimony or child support court orders
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Asset verification">
    - Bank statements (typically 60 days, all pages)
    - Investment account statements
    - Retirement account statements
    - Gift letters (if using gift funds for down payment)
    - Documentation of large deposits
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credit and debt">
    - Credit report (lender pulls this directly)
    - Explanation letters for any derogatory items
    - Documentation of debts not appearing on credit report
    - Bankruptcy or foreclosure discharge papers (if applicable)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Identification">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

</Note>

## What You Qualify For vs What You Can Afford

Lenders calculate the maximum loan amount you qualify for based on debt-to-income ratios. Most programs allow up to 43% DTI, some up to 50%.

But qualifying for a loan amount doesn't mean you should borrow that much.

> **A good lender might say:** "You qualify for 400K, but based on your income and lifestyle, I'd recommend staying closer to 350K. That brings your payment down and gives you breathing room for savings, travel, and unexpected expenses."

> **A transactional lender will say:** "You're approved for \$400K. Let's find you a house at that price."

One approach protects you. The other maximizes the lender's commission.

Consider involving your [CPA or financial advisor](/service-categories/accountants-tax/overview) in the conversation. Looking at your finances from all angles gives you the full picture before committing to the largest purchase of your life.

## Red Flags in the Pre-Approval Process

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The 10-minute pre-approval">
    If you get pre-approved quickly with no documentation, it's not real. Problems will surface during [underwriting](/service-categories/mortgage-lenders/mortgage-timeline) after you've signed a contract and deposited earnest money.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't explain pre-qualification vs pre-approval">
    If your lender can't explain the difference or calls a pre-qualification a "pre-approval," find a different lender.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Focus only on rate">
    Great lenders don't just quote rates. They help you understand trade-offs, structure offers competitively, and navigate problems. If the pitch begins and ends with "I'll get you the lowest rate," keep looking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not available when you need them">
    Real estate is 24/7. Open houses are on weekends. Offer deadlines are tight. If your lender clocks out at 5pm, you'll be at a disadvantage when the pressure is on.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## After Pre-Approval: What Not to Do

<Warning>
  Avoid major financial changes after pre-approval:

  - Don't open new credit cards or loans
  - Don't make large purchases (cars, furniture, appliances)
  - Don't change jobs without consulting your loan officer
  - Don't move money between accounts without documentation

  These changes can affect qualification and delay or prevent closing.
</Warning>

## Pre-Approval Expiration

Pre-approval letters expire, typically after 60-90 days. Credit reports, income, and financial situations change over time.

**When updates are needed:**

- Letter expires before contract is signed
- Job or income changes occur
- New debts are taken on
- Large purchases are made
- Offer price exceeds original pre-approval amount

Notify your loan officer of any financial changes during the home search.

## Research Multiple Lenders

Interview at least three lenders before committing. Compare:

- Pre-approval thoroughness (do they verify documentation?)
- Communication and responsiveness
- Availability (evenings and weekends?)
- Local market knowledge
- [Loan programs](/service-categories/mortgage-lenders/loan-types) offered
- Fees and rate competitiveness

The lender with the lowest rate isn't always the best choice. Speed, communication, and experience matter just as much.
