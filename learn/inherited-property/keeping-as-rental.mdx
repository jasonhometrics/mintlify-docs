## Converting to a Rental Property

Keeping inherited property as a rental generates ongoing income while preserving the asset for future appreciation. This path requires heirs to take on landlord responsibilities or hire professional management.

Converting to rental works best when the property is in a strong rental market, the numbers support positive cash flow, and heirs are prepared for the ongoing commitment of property ownership.

## Financial Analysis

Before deciding to rent, calculate whether the property will generate positive cash flow or cost money each month.

**Monthly income:**

- Market rent for the property (research comparable rentals in the area)

**Monthly expenses:**

- Mortgage payment (if applicable)
- Property taxes (divided by 12)
- Insurance (landlord policy, divided by 12)
- [Property management](/service-categories/property-management/overview) (typically 8-12% of rent)
- Maintenance reserve (typically 5-10% of rent)
- Vacancy allowance (typically 5-8% of rent)
- HOA fees (if applicable)
- Utilities (if owner-paid)

**Cash flow calculation:**

| Item                      | Example   |
| ------------------------- | --------- |
| Monthly rent              | \$2,000   |
| Mortgage                  | -\$800    |
| Property taxes            | -\$300    |
| Insurance                 | -\$150    |
| Property management (10%) | -\$200    |
| Maintenance reserve (5%)  | -\$100    |
| Vacancy allowance (5%)    | -\$100    |
| **Net cash flow**         | **\$350** |

<Note>
  Inherited properties without a mortgage have a significant advantage. No mortgage payment often means strong positive cash flow even after all other expenses.
</Note>

## Property Preparation

Rental properties have different preparation requirements than owner-occupied homes.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Safety and habitability">
    Landlords must provide habitable housing. Address safety issues, functioning systems (HVAC, plumbing, electrical), and any code violations before renting. Many jurisdictions require rental inspections or licenses.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Durable finishes">
    Choose materials that withstand tenant turnover. Hard flooring outlasts carpet. Semi-gloss paint cleans easier than flat. Quality fixtures reduce maintenance calls.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Appliance decisions">
    Decide which appliances to include. Stove and refrigerator are typically expected. Washer, dryer, and dishwasher vary by market. More appliances mean more maintenance responsibility.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personal property removal">
    Remove all personal belongings. Furnished rentals exist but are less common and require different lease terms and insurance coverage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Documentation">
    Photograph the property thoroughly before the first tenant. Document the condition of walls, floors, fixtures, and appliances. This protects against [security deposit](/service-categories/legal/landlord-tenant/security-deposits) disputes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Management Options

Heirs must decide whether to manage the property themselves or hire a property manager.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Self-management">
    Handling landlord duties directly saves management fees but requires time, availability, and knowledge.

    **Responsibilities include:**

    - Marketing and showing the property
    - Screening tenant applications
    - Executing [leases](/service-categories/legal/landlord-tenant/lease-agreements) and collecting deposits
    - Collecting rent and enforcing lease terms
    - Responding to maintenance requests
    - Coordinating repairs with contractors
    - Handling tenant issues and complaints
    - Managing turnover and re-leasing
    - Complying with [landlord-tenant laws](/service-categories/legal/landlord-tenant/overview)

    **Best suited for:**

    - Heirs who live near the property
    - Those with time and interest in hands-on management
    - Single properties with reliable tenants
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Professional property management">
    [Property managers](/service-categories/property-management/overview) handle day-to-day operations for a fee, typically 8-12% of monthly rent plus leasing fees for new tenants.

    **Services typically include:**

    - Tenant placement and screening
    - Rent collection and accounting
    - Maintenance coordination
    - Regular property inspections
    - Lease enforcement
    - [Eviction](/service-categories/legal/landlord-tenant/eviction-process) processing if needed
    - Financial reporting to owners

    **Best suited for:**

    - Heirs who live far from the property
    - Those without time or interest in management tasks
    - Multiple heirs who want professional oversight
    - Properties requiring frequent attention
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Legal Requirements

Landlords must comply with federal, state, and local laws governing rental property.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fair housing">
    Federal [Fair Housing](/service-categories/legal/consumer-protections/fair-housing) Act prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, or disability. State and local laws may add protected classes. Fair housing applies to advertising, tenant selection, lease terms, and all landlord-tenant interactions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Landlord-tenant laws">
    State laws govern [lease requirements](/service-categories/legal/landlord-tenant/lease-agreements), [security deposits](/service-categories/legal/landlord-tenant/security-deposits), notice periods, entry rights, habitability standards, and [eviction procedures](/service-categories/legal/landlord-tenant/eviction-process). Requirements vary significantly by state.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Local regulations">
    Many jurisdictions require rental licenses, inspections, or registrations. Some have rent control or additional tenant protections. Check city and county requirements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lead paint disclosure">
    Properties built before 1978 require lead paint disclosure to tenants. Landlords must provide an EPA-approved pamphlet and disclose known lead paint hazards.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Insurance Requirements

Standard homeowners insurance does not cover rental properties. Landlords need different coverage.

| Coverage Type              | What It Covers                                                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Landlord policy (DP-3)** | Property damage, liability, loss of rental income              |
| **Liability coverage**     | Injuries to tenants or visitors on the property                |
| **Loss of rent coverage**  | Income lost if property is uninhabitable due to covered damage |
| **Umbrella policy**        | Additional liability protection beyond base policy limits      |

<Warning>
  Notify your insurance company when converting to rental. Claims may be denied if the property is rented under a standard homeowners policy. See [specialty coverage](/service-categories/homeowners-insurance/specialty-coverage) for landlord policy options.
</Warning>

## Tax Implications

[Rental income is taxable](/service-categories/accountants-tax/rental-property-taxes), but landlords can deduct expenses and depreciation to reduce tax liability.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rental income reporting">
    Report all rental income on Schedule E of your tax return. Income includes rent, late fees, and any other payments from tenants.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deductible expenses">
    Deduct ordinary and necessary expenses for managing and maintaining the rental:

    - Mortgage interest
    - Property taxes
    - Insurance premiums
    - Property management fees
    - Repairs and maintenance
    - Utilities (if owner-paid)
    - Advertising
    - Legal and professional fees
    - Travel to the property for rental activities
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Depreciation">
    Deduct a portion of the property's value each year as depreciation. Residential rentals depreciate over 27.5 years. Only the building value depreciates, not land. For inherited property, depreciation is calculated from the [stepped-up basis](/learn/inherited-property/tax-implications).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Depreciation recapture">
    When you eventually sell, depreciation claimed over the years is "recaptured" and taxed at up to 25%. This applies regardless of how long you held the property.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="1031 exchange option">
    Selling a rental property triggers capital gains tax. A [1031 exchange](/service-categories/accountants-tax/1031-exchanges) allows deferring that tax by reinvesting proceeds into another investment property within specific timeframes and rules.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When Multiple Heirs Own the Rental

Joint ownership of rental property requires ongoing coordination.

**Decisions requiring agreement:**

- Rent amount and lease terms
- Tenant selection
- Major repairs and improvements
- Whether to hire or change property managers
- How to handle operating shortfalls
- When and whether to sell

**Structuring ownership:**

- Written agreement outlining decision-making, expense sharing, and [buyout](/service-categories/legal/ownership-changes/buyout-scenarios) terms
- Consider forming an [LLC](/service-categories/legal/property-issues/llcs-and-business-structures) for liability protection and clearer management structure
- Establish a joint account for rental income and expenses
- Define what happens if one heir wants to exit

<Note>
  Disagreements among co-owners are easier to resolve with a written operating agreement established upfront.
</Note>

## Exit Strategy

Consider how and when the property might eventually be sold.

**Common exit triggers:**

- Significant repair needs that exceed investment appetite
- Market appreciation reaches target value
- Change in heirs' circumstances or goals
- Tenant or management problems
- Better investment opportunities elsewhere

**Exit options:**

- Traditional sale (capital gains tax applies)
- [1031 exchange](/service-categories/accountants-tax/1031-exchanges) into another investment property (defers taxes)
- Sell to a co-heir ([buyout](/service-categories/legal/ownership-changes/buyout-scenarios))
- Gift or bequest to next generation (estate planning considerations)

<Tip>
  Start with a one-year lease to test whether rental ownership fits your goals. You can always sell later if the experience does not meet expectations.
