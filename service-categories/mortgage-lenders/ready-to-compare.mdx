# Ready to Compare Lenders?

**You know what to look for. Now compare your options.**

Research local mortgage lenders with verified reviews, transaction volume, and weekend availability. Interview at least three before you commit.

  **Filter by what matters:**
  
  - Monthly transaction volume
  - Google review ratings
  - Weekend/evening availability
  - Local market experience
  - First-time buyer programs
  - Loan types offered (Conventional, FHA, VA, USDA, Jumbo)

**Don't settle for the first referral.** Compare experience, communication style, and rates. The lender you choose determines whether your transaction closes smoothly or falls apart 30 days in.

**Bring your questions from the "How to Evaluate" page.** The right questions separate experienced professionals from transactional ones.
