Special pricing exists to signal appreciation, community alignment, and long-term relationships — not to create price competition.

## Discounts That Build Trust

Discounts that tend to reinforce trust include:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Repeat-client pricing">
    Signals long-term relationship focus. Shows you value customer retention over constant acquisition. Rewards loyalty without requiring upfront commitment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="First responder or military discounts">
    Communicates community values and appreciation for service. Creates alignment with customers who share similar values.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Teacher or healthcare worker discounts">
    Recognizes professions that serve communities. Signals alignment with education and public health priorities.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

These discounts communicate values rather than price positioning.

---

## Discounts That Create Risk

Discounts that often create problems include:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Blanket percentage discounts">
    "10% off everything" positions you as competing on price. Attracts customers who prioritize cost over quality. Creates expectation of negotiation on future transactions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lowest price positioning">
    "We'll beat any competitor's price" commoditizes your service. Attracts mismatched clients who will leave for a better deal. Unsustainable long-term.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Constantly changing offers">
    Frequent discount changes create confusion and train customers to wait for deals. Reduces perceived value of standard pricing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Writing Clear Discount Terms

Clear terms reduce confusion and prevent disputes. Be explicit about:

- Who qualifies
- What documentation is required
- Whether the discount applies per transaction or has limits
- Whether discounts can be combined

<Warning>
Ambiguous discount terms lead to disputes and negative reviews. Clarity builds confidence.
</Warning>

## When Not to Offer Discounts

Discounts aren't required. If your value is specialization, speed, risk reduction, or expertise, a discount may not improve outcomes.

Consider whether discounting aligns with your positioning:

| Your positioning | Discount fit |
| :--- | :--- |
| Premium service, specialized expertise | Poor fit — discounts undermine positioning |
| Fast turnaround, convenience | Neutral — depends on market |
| Community-focused, relationship-driven | Good fit — values-based discounts reinforce positioning |
| High-volume, efficiency-focused | Good fit — repeat client discounts encourage retention |
