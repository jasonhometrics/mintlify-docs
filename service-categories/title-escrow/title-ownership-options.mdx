Title refers to legal ownership of property. How title is held determines who owns the property, what happens when an owner dies, and how the property can be sold or transferred.

Different ownership structures carry different legal and tax implications. Choosing the appropriate structure depends on marital status, estate planning goals, and state law.

## How to Hold Title

Ownership structure determines rights, responsibilities, and what happens to property when an owner dies.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sole Ownership">
    **Definition:** One person holds complete ownership.

    **Who uses it:** Single individuals, divorced individuals, or married individuals in states allowing separate property ownership.

    **Key features:**

    - Owner has full control over property decisions
    - Property passes through probate upon death
    - No automatic transfer to other parties
    - Can be willed to any beneficiary

    **Estate planning:** Property must go through probate unless held in trust. Will determines who inherits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship">
    **Definition:** Two or more people own equal shares with automatic transfer to surviving owners upon death.

    **Who uses it:** Unmarried partners, family members, or friends purchasing property together.

    **Key features:**

    - All owners have equal ownership percentages
    - Property automatically transfers to surviving owners (bypasses probate)
    - Any owner can force sale through partition action
    - Creditors can place liens on individual owner's interest

    **Estate planning:** Avoids probate but limits control over who inherits. Last surviving owner has sole control.

    **Example:** Two siblings own a vacation home. When one dies, the survivor automatically owns 100% without probate proceedings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tenancy in Common">
    **Definition:** Two or more people own property with individual, divisible interests that can be unequal.

    **Who uses it:** Investors, business partners, or family members wanting flexible ownership percentages.

    **Key features:**

    - Ownership shares can be unequal (e.g., 60/40 split)
    - Each owner can sell or transfer their share independently
    - No automatic right of survivorship
    - Each owner's share passes through probate to their heirs

    **Estate planning:** Owners control who inherits their share through will or trust. Heirs become co-owners with remaining parties.

    **Example:** Three investors buy property with 50/30/20 ownership split. Each can sell their share or leave it to heirs independently.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tenancy by the Entirety">
    **Definition:** Married couples own property as a single legal unit with automatic survivorship.

    **Who uses it:** Married couples in states that recognize this ownership form (approximately 25 states).

    **Key features:**

    - Both spouses must consent to any sale or transfer
    - Property automatically transfers to surviving spouse
    - Creditors of one spouse cannot place liens (in most states)
    - Provides asset protection from individual debts

    **Estate planning:** Avoids probate and provides creditor protection. Converts to tenancy in common if couple divorces.

    **Tax considerations:** May offer estate tax benefits in some states. Consult tax advisor.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Community Property">
    **Definition:** Married couples own equal shares of property acquired during marriage.

    **Who uses it:** Married couples in community property states (Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin).

    **Key features:**

    - Each spouse owns 50% regardless of who paid
    - Property acquired before marriage or through inheritance/gift remains separate
    - Both spouses must consent to sale
    - Can be held with or without right of survivorship

    **Estate planning:** Without survivorship language, deceased spouse's half passes through probate. With survivorship, bypasses probate.

    **Tax considerations:** Provides step-up in basis for entire property value (not just deceased spouse's half) upon first spouse's death.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Trust Ownership">
    **Definition:** Property is held in a trust with designated trustees managing for beneficiaries.

    **Who uses it:** Individuals with estate planning goals, privacy concerns, or wanting to avoid probate.

    **Key features:**

    - Avoids probate entirely
    - Maintains privacy (trusts aren't public record)

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="LLC or Corporate Ownership">
    **Definition:** Property is owned by a business entity rather than individuals.

    **Who uses it:** Real estate investors, landlords, or business owners.

    **Key features:**

    - Provides liability protection for owners
    - Separates personal and business assets
    - May offer tax advantages
    - Allows multiple investors with defined roles

    **Considerations:**

    - Requires entity formation and maintenance

## Common Title Issues

Title problems can delay or prevent property transfers. Most issues can be resolved before closing.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Liens">
    **What they are:** Legal claims against property for unpaid debts.

    **Types:**

    - **Tax liens:** Unpaid property taxes or IRS debts
    - **Mechanic's liens:** Unpaid contractor or supplier bills
    - **Judgment liens:** Court-ordered debt collection
    - **HOA liens:** Unpaid homeowners association fees

    **How they're resolved:** Liens must be paid off or negotiated before closing. Sellers typically pay from sale proceeds. Title insurance covers undiscovered liens.

    **Prevention:** Title search during contract period identifies liens before closing. Verify all liens are released before recording new deed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Easements and Encumbrances">
    **What they are:** Rights others have to use the property.

    **Types:**

    - **Utility easements:** Power, water, sewer access across property
    - **Access easements:** Neighbor's right to cross property to reach their land
    - **Conservation easements:** Restrictions on development
    - **Drainage easements:** Water flow management rights

    **Impact:** Easements limit how property can be used but don't prevent ownership transfer. Most are recorded and disclosed during title search.

    **Resolution:** Easements typically remain with property and transfer to new owner. Some can be released or relocated through negotiation with easement holder.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Encroachments and Boundary Disputes">
    **What they are:** Structures or improvements crossing property lines.

    **Examples:**

    - Fence built over boundary line
    - Building extending onto neighboring lot
    - Driveway crossing property line
    - Tree branches or roots crossing boundaries

    **Discovery:** Survey ordered during contract period reveals encroachments. Visual inspection may show obvious issues.

    **Resolution:**

    - Negotiate boundary line adjustment
    - Seek easement from affected party
    - Remove encroaching structure
    - Obtain encroachment agreement

    **Title insurance:** Standard policies exclude known encroachments. Enhanced coverage may include protection after additional survey review.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clouds on Title">
    **What they are:** Any claim or document that questions ownership or creates uncertainty.

    **Examples:**

    - Missing signatures on previous deeds
    - Unclear descriptions in historical documents
    - Unresolved estate issues from previous owners
    - Improperly recorded documents
    - Claims from unknown heirs

    **Resolution:** Requires legal action to "quiet title" through court proceedings. Process can take months. Title company may refuse to insure until cloud is removed.

    **Impact:** Delays closing until resolved. Sellers should address clouds before listing property.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Chain of Title Gaps">
    **What they are:** Missing or unclear ownership records in property history.

    **Causes:**

    - Lost or destroyed records
    - Improperly recorded transfers
    - Name changes not properly documented
    - Probate proceedings not completed

    **Resolution:** Requires legal research to establish complete ownership chain. May need affidavits from previous owners or heirs. Court proceedings sometimes necessary.

    **Prevention:** Title companies search historical records during contract period. Gaps discovered early allow time for resolution before closing.
  </Accordion>

## Choosing How to Hold Title

Consult with real estate attorneys and tax advisors before deciding ownership structure. Consider:

- Marital status and state law
- Estate planning goals
- Asset protection needs
- Tax implications
- Number of owners and their relationships
- Future sale or transfer plans

Ownership structure can be changed after purchase through quitclaim deed or other legal documents, but changes may trigger tax consequences or require refinancing approval.
