description: "Insurance, valuation coverage, and claims"

Moving creates risk of loss or damage to belongings. Understanding valuation coverage options and the claims process helps ensure adequate protection and fair resolution if problems occur.

Movers offer valuation coverage, not insurance. The distinction matters for protection and claims.

## Valuation vs Insurance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What valuation coverage is">
    Valuation is the mover's liability for loss or damage. It determines the maximum amount a mover will pay if something goes wrong.

    Technically not insurance. Governed by federal regulations for interstate moves.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What insurance is">
    Actual insurance policies can be purchased separately from third-party insurers.

    - More comprehensive coverage
    - Claims paid by insurance company
    - May cover more scenarios
    - Purchased separately from moving contract
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why the distinction matters">
    Valuation limitations may not provide adequate protection:

    - Limited by weight rather than value
    - Excludes certain items
    - Has deductibles
    - Requires proving mover's fault

    Separate insurance may provide better protection for valuable items.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Valuation Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Released value (basic)">
    Minimum coverage required for interstate moves.

    **Coverage:** 60 cents per pound per item

    **Example:** 50-pound TV worth \$1,000 damaged = \$30 maximum payout

    **Cost:** Usually included in move cost

    **Protection level:** Minimal. Not recommended for anything valuable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Full value protection">
    Mover responsible for replacement value of lost or damaged items.

    **Coverage options:**

    - Replacement with similar item
    - Repair of damaged item
    - Cash settlement at current value

    **Cost:** Typically 1-2% of declared shipment value

    **Example:** \$50,000 declared value at 1% = \$500 for full protection

    **Deductible:** May range from \$0 to \$500+

    **Protection level:** Significantly better than released value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Declared value">
    You declare total shipment value. Mover's liability limited to declared amount.

    **Important:** Declaring lower value to save money means lower payout if claim.

    **Minimum declaration:** Usually \$6 per pound times shipment weight.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Released value protection (60 cents per pound) provides almost no real protection. A 100-pound dresser worth \$2,000 would pay only 60 if destroyed. Always consider full value protection for interstate moves.
</Warning>

## Understanding Full Value Protection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What it covers">
    - Items damaged during move
    - Items lost during move
    - Items destroyed during move

    Mover must repair, replace, or pay current market value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What it doesn't cover">
    Common exclusions:

    - Items packed by owner (mover may dispute cause)
    - Items with pre-existing damage
    - Mechanical/electrical failure of appliances
    - Items on excluded list (see below)
    - Acts of God in some cases
    - Items not on inventory
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Excluded items">
    High-value items often excluded or limited:

    - Jewelry
    - Cash and coins
    - Important documents
    - Antiques (may require separate appraisal)
    - Artwork
    - Collectibles
    - Furs
    - Firearms

    Check policy for specific exclusions and declare high-value items separately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deductibles">
    Full value protection often has deductibles:

    - \$0 deductible: Higher premium
    - \$250 deductible: Moderate premium
    - \$500 deductible: Lower premium

    Higher deductible = lower cost but more out-of-pocket per claim.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cost factors">
    Full value protection cost based on:

    - Declared value of shipment
    - Deductible chosen
    - Mover's loss history
    - Item-specific coverage

    Typically 1-2% of declared value.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Third-Party Moving Insurance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When to consider">
    Separate insurance makes sense when:

    - Moving very valuable items
    - Mover's coverage has significant exclusions
    - You want broader protection
    - You're doing a DIY move
    - Moving antiques, art, or collectibles
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Coverage types">
    **Full replacement value:** Items replaced at current retail cost.

    **Actual cash value:** Depreciated value of items.

    **Total loss:** Pays declared value if entire shipment lost.

    **Pairs and sets:** Coverage if one piece of set is damaged.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Providers">
    Companies offering moving insurance:

    - MovingInsurance.com
    - Bakers Insurance
    - Relocation Insurance Group
    - Some homeowners insurance riders

    Compare coverage, exclusions, and claims processes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cost">
    Third-party insurance typically:

    - 1-5% of coverage amount
    - Varies by provider and coverage type
    - May have minimum premiums

    Compare to mover's full value protection cost.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
