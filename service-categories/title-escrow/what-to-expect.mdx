# What to Expect

Title and escrow services coordinate the legal and financial aspects of property transfers from contract execution through closing. The process involves title research, fund management, document preparation, and recording.

Understanding the timeline, requirements, and common procedures helps all parties prepare for their transaction.

<Note>
The following timeline reflects a typical 30-day purchase transaction. Refinances and cash purchases follow different schedules. Specific timelines vary based on contract terms, lender requirements, and local practices.
</Note>

## Understanding Earnest Money

Earnest money is a deposit demonstrating serious purchase intent. The deposit goes into an escrow account and remains there until the transaction closes or terminates according to contract terms.

**Typical amount:** 1-3% of the sale price. On a $300,000 property, earnest money ranges from $3,000 to $9,000.

**Due date:** Purchase contracts typically require earnest money deposits within 3 business days of contract execution. Missing this deadline may constitute breach of contract.

**Escrow protection:** The title company holds deposits in a neutral escrow account. Neither buyers nor sellers can access funds until contract conditions authorize release.

### What Happens to Earnest Money

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="If the transaction closes">
    Earnest money applies toward the buyer's funds due at closing. It reduces the amount buyers must bring to closing but does not reduce the total purchase price.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="If the transaction terminates for valid contractual reasons">
    Buyers receive full refunds when:
    - Lenders deny financing despite good-faith efforts (financing contingency)
    - Inspections reveal defects sellers won't repair (inspection contingency)
    - Appraisals come in below purchase price and price cannot be renegotiated
    - Title defects cannot be resolved
    - Other contingencies specified in the contract are not satisfied
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="If buyers breach the contract">
    Sellers may retain earnest money when:
    - Buyers withdraw without valid contractual reason
    - Buyers miss critical contract deadlines
    - Buyers refuse to close after all contingencies are satisfied
    
    Contracts specify dispute resolution procedures if parties disagree about breach.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
**Verify wire instructions via phone before transferring earnest money.** Use phone numbers from the title company's website or contract documents, never from emails. Email accounts are frequently compromised in fraud schemes targeting earnest money deposits.
</Warning>

## What Happens After Closing

**Recording:** Deed and mortgage documents are filed with the county recording office. This creates public record of the ownership transfer. Recording typically occurs the same day or next business day after document signing.

**Title insurance:** Owner's title insurance policies are delivered 30-60 days after closing. This document should be retained permanently. Coverage continues for as long as the owner or heirs hold interest in the property.

**Final documents:** Complete closing packages (deed, mortgage, settlement statement, title insurance commitment) are delivered within 30 days of closing.

**Ongoing support:** Title companies remain available to answer questions about recorded documents, insurance coverage, or fund distribution.

## Costs and Fees

Title and escrow fees vary by location, property value, and state regulations. Multiple line items cover different services.

## Common Misconceptions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='"The lender chooses the title company"'>
    Buyers and sellers have the legal right to choose title representation. Lenders may recommend companies but cannot require specific providers under federal law (RESPA). Local customs vary on whether buyer or seller typically selects the company.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title='"All title companies charge the same"'>
    Title insurance premiums are often state-regulated, but settlement fees and other charges vary significantly between companies. Comparing quotes from multiple providers can identify cost differences.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title='"Title insurance only protects the lender"'>
    Two separate policies serve different purposes. Lender's policy protects the lender's loan amount. Owner's policy protects the buyer's ownership interest. Each covers different risks and benefits different parties.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title='"Earnest money is lost if financing falls through"'>
    Financing contingencies protect buyers. If lenders deny loans despite good-faith efforts, buyers receive earnest money refunds. Deposits are only at risk if buyers breach contract terms without valid contractual reason.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title='"Notaries can answer questions during closing"'>
    Notaries witness signatures and verify identity. They cannot provide legal advice or explain document terms. Licensed settlement agents can answer questions and provide guidance during the signing process.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title='"Wire instructions sent by email are safe"'>
    Email accounts are frequently compromised in fraud schemes. All wire instructions should be verified via phone using independently looked-up contact information before transferring funds.
  </Accordion>
