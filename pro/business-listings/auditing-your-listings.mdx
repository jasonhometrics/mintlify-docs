title: "Auditing Your Listings"
description: "How to find existing listings, identify inconsistencies, and claim unclaimed profiles"
---

A listing audit identifies all existing online profiles for a business and evaluates them for accuracy and consistency. This process reveals duplicates, outdated information, and unclaimed listings that may be providing incorrect details to consumers.

Regular audits form the foundation of effective listing management. Issues cannot be corrected until they are discovered.

## Why Audit Listings

Listings accumulate over time from multiple sources:

- Profiles created intentionally by the business
- Auto-generated listings from data aggregators
- User-submitted information on review platforms
- Scraped data from websites or public records
- Leftover listings from previous addresses or phone numbers

<Warning>
Many businesses have listings they did not create and do not know exist. These unclaimed listings may contain outdated information that conflicts with official profiles, creating [NAP inconsistencies](/pro/business-listings/overview#nap-consistency) that reduce search visibility.
</Warning>

## Finding Existing Listings

### Manual Search Method

Search for the business using variations of its name, address, and phone number:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search business name">
    Enter the exact business name in Google. Review the first 3-5 pages of results for directory listings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search name variations">
    Try abbreviations, former names, and common misspellings. Search "Smith Title" if the official name is "Smith Title Company LLC."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search phone number">
    Enter the business phone number in quotes. This reveals listings that may have wrong names or addresses but correct phone numbers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search address">
    Enter the street address to find listings tied to the location, including those from previous tenants or incorrect business names.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check major platforms directly">
    Visit Google, Yelp, Bing, Apple Maps, Facebook, and industry directories. Search within each platform rather than relying only on Google results.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Automated Scan Tools

Several services scan multiple directories and report findings:

| Tool | Cost | Features |
|------|------|----------|
| Moz Local Check | Free | Scans major directories, shows inconsistencies |
| Yext Listings Scan | Free | Broad scan, detailed report |
| BrightLocal | Free scan, paid management | Comprehensive audit with tracking |
| Semrush Listing Management | Paid | Ongoing monitoring included |

<Tip>
Free scans provide a starting point but may not catch all listings. Combine automated tools with manual searches for thorough coverage.
</Tip>

## Recording Findings

Document each listing discovered during the audit:

### Information to Track

| Field | What to Record |
|-------|----------------|
| Platform | Directory or site name |
| URL | Direct link to the listing |
| Claimed status | Whether the business controls the listing |
| Business name | Exactly as displayed |
| Address | Full address as shown |
| Phone | Number displayed |
| Hours | If listed |
| Issues | Specific problems identified |

<Info>
A spreadsheet works well for tracking listings. Include columns for each NAP element plus notes on issues and action items. This becomes the reference document for corrections.
</Info>

### Example Audit Spreadsheet

```
| Platform | URL | Claimed | Name | Address | Phone | Issues |
|----------|-----|---------|------|---------|-------|--------|
| Google   | ... | Yes     | Smith Title Company | 100 Main St, Ste 200 | (410) 555-1234 | None |
| Yelp     | ... | No      | Smith Title Co | 100 Main Street #200 | 410-555-1234 | Name abbreviated, address format |
| Bing     | ... | No      | Smith Title Company LLC | 100 Main St | (410) 555-1234 | Has LLC, missing suite |
```

## Identifying Issues

Common problems discovered during audits:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="NAP Inconsistencies">
    Name, address, or phone variations across platforms. Even minor differences like "Street" vs "St" or missing suite numbers create inconsistency signals.
    
    **Action**: Standardize on one format and correct all variations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Unclaimed Listings">
    Profiles that exist but are not controlled by the business. These cannot be edited and may contain outdated or user-submitted information.
    
    **Action**: Claim the listing through the platform's verification process.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Duplicate Listings">
    Multiple listings for the same business on the same platform. Often caused by address changes, name changes, or multiple people creating profiles.
    
    **Action**: Claim the most accurate listing and request removal of duplicates.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Outdated Information">
    Old addresses, phone numbers, or hours. Common after moves, phone system changes, or schedule updates.
    
    **Action**: Update with current information after claiming.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Incorrect Categories">
    Wrong business type or category selection. A title company listed as "Insurance Company" reduces relevance for title-related searches.
    
    **Action**: Correct primary and secondary categories after claiming.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Missing Listings">
    Major platforms with no listing present. Gaps in coverage mean missed discovery opportunities.
    
    **Action**: Create new listings on priority platforms. See [Types of Listings](/pro/business-listings/types-of-listings#listing-priority-framework) for prioritization.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Claiming Unclaimed Listings

Claiming a listing grants the business control to edit information, respond to reviews, and add content.

### General Claiming Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the claim option">
    Look for "Claim this business," "Own this business?", or similar links on the listing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create or sign in to an account">
    Most platforms require an account. Use a business email address rather than personal email.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete verification">
    Platforms verify ownership through phone calls, postcards, email, or document submission.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update information">
    Once verified, correct any inaccurate information immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Verification Methods by Platform

| Platform | Primary Verification | Timeframe |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| Google Business Profile | Postcard, phone, email, video | Days to weeks |
| Bing Places | Phone, email | Minutes to days |
| Apple Business Connect | Email verification | Days |
| Yelp | Phone call | Immediate |
| Facebook | Admin access or documents | Varies |

<Warning>
Verification postcards must be received at the business address. If the address is wrong on the listing, the postcard will go to the wrong location. Correct the address first if possible, or use alternative verification methods.
</Warning>

## Handling Duplicates

Duplicate listings confuse search engines and split review history. Removing duplicates consolidates signals on a single authoritative listing.

### Duplicate Resolution Process

1. **Identify the primary listing**: Choose the listing with more reviews, longer history, or better information
2. **Claim the primary listing**: Complete verification if not already claimed
3. **Report duplicates for removal**: Use the platform's duplicate reporting feature
4. **Document the request**: Keep records in case follow-up is needed

<Tip>
On Google, use the "Suggest an edit" feature on duplicate listings to mark them as "Duplicate of another place." For persistent duplicates, contact Google Business Profile support.
</Tip>

## Audit Frequency

| Situation | Recommended Frequency |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Initial audit | Once, thoroughly |
| Routine maintenance | Quarterly |
| After address change | Immediately, then weekly for 8 weeks |
| After phone change | Immediately, then monthly for 3 months |
| After rebranding | Immediately, then monthly for 6 months |

Major changes require more frequent monitoring because data propagates through the [aggregator network](/pro/business-listings/types-of-listings#data-aggregators) over weeks or months.
