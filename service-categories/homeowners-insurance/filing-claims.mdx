Filing a homeowners insurance claim initiates the process of recovering losses after covered damage. How you handle the claim affects both the outcome and the speed of resolution.

Understanding the process before you need it helps ensure you receive fair compensation when losses occur.

## When to File a Claim

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="File a claim when">
    - Damage exceeds your deductible significantly
    - Major structural damage (roof, foundation, walls)
    - Fire, smoke, or water damage
    - Theft of valuable items
    - Liability incident (someone injured on property)
    - Damage from covered peril (wind, hail, falling tree)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider not filing when">
    - Damage is close to or below deductible
    - Minor cosmetic issues
    - Damage you can easily afford to repair
    - Incident might be excluded from coverage

    Small claims can increase premiums more than the payout is worth. Calculate long-term cost before filing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The claims calculation">
    Before filing, estimate:

    - Cost of repairs
    - Minus your deductible
    - Equals potential claim payout

    If payout is small (under \$1,000 to \$2,000), premium increase over several years may exceed benefit. Consider paying out of pocket.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Always report">
    Some incidents should be reported even if you don't file a claim:

    - Injuries to others on your property
    - Incidents that might result in lawsuit
    - Damage that could worsen over time

    Late reporting can result in claim denial. When in doubt, notify your insurer.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  You can report an incident and ask questions without formally filing a claim. Ask your insurer about "inquiry only" options to understand coverage without triggering a claim on your record.
</Note>

## The Claims Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Document the damage">
    Before touching anything (unless safety requires it):

    - Take photos and video of all damage
    - Photograph damaged items up close and in context
    - Document serial numbers on electronics
    - Note date and time damage discovered
    - Save damaged items for adjuster inspection
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prevent further damage">
    Take reasonable steps to protect property from additional damage:

    - Cover holes in roof with tarp
    - Board up broken windows
    - Turn off water if pipes burst
    - Remove water to prevent mold

    Keep receipts for emergency repairs. These are typically reimbursable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contact your insurer">
    Report the claim as soon as possible. Most insurers have 24/7 claim reporting.

    **Be prepared to provide:**

    - Policy number
    - Date and time of loss
    - Description of what happened
    - Extent of damage
    - Contact information
    - Whether anyone was injured
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete claim forms">
    Insurer will provide claim forms to complete. Fill out thoroughly and accurately.

    - Describe damage in detail
    - List all damaged or destroyed items
    - Include values and purchase dates if known
    - Attach documentation and photos
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meet with adjuster">
    Insurer assigns claims adjuster to evaluate damage. Adjuster will:

    - Inspect the damage in person
    - Review your documentation
    - Assess repair costs
    - Determine coverage and payout

    Be present during inspection. Point out all damage. Ask questions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive estimate">
    Adjuster provides repair estimate and coverage determination. Review carefully.

    Estimate may be for repairs or replacement depending on damage and policy terms.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive payment">
    If claim is approved, insurer issues payment.

    **Payment may be:**

    - Direct to you
    - Joint check with mortgage lender (for large claims)
    - Direct to contractor (if you authorize)

    May receive initial payment with supplement after repairs reveal additional damage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete repairs">
    Use claim funds to repair damage. Keep all receipts.

    If actual costs exceed estimate, file supplemental claim for additional funds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Documentation Essentials

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Photos and video">
    Visual documentation is critical.

    **What to capture:**

    - Wide shots showing overall damage
    - Close-ups of specific damage
    - Multiple angles
    - Date-stamped if possible
    - Before photos if available (from home inventory)

    Take more than you think necessary. You can't go back after repairs begin.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inventory of damaged items">
    Create detailed list of damaged or destroyed belongings.

    **Include:**

    - Item description
    - Brand and model
    - Purchase date (approximate if unknown)
    - Purchase price
    - Current replacement cost
    - Serial numbers for electronics

    Receipts strengthen your claim but aren't always required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Repair estimates">
    Get estimates from licensed contractors.

    - At least 2-3 estimates for major repairs
    - Detailed line-item breakdown
    - Contractor license information
    - Written estimates, not verbal

    Your estimates may differ from adjuster's. Both inform final settlement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Receipts and records">
    Save documentation of:

    - Emergency repairs
    - Temporary living expenses
    - Storage costs
    - Any expenses related to the loss

    Organize chronologically. Keep originals and copies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Communication log">
    Track all interactions with insurer.

    - Date and time of calls
    - Who you spoke with
    - What was discussed
    - Claim number reference
    - Follow-up items

    Written records protect you if disputes arise.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Never dispose of damaged items before the adjuster inspects them. Insurer may deny claim if they cannot verify damage. Keep damaged items until claim is fully resolved.
</Warning>

## Working with Adjusters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Types of adjusters">
    **Staff adjuster:** Employee of insurance company. Works for your insurer.

    **Independent adjuster:** Contractor hired by insurer. Works for insurer but not employee.

    **Public adjuster:** Works for you, the policyholder. You hire and pay them (typically percentage of settlement). Advocates for your interests.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="During the inspection">
    - Be present and engaged
    - Point out all damage, even minor items
    - Provide documentation you've gathered
    - Ask questions about process and timeline
    - Take notes on what adjuster says
    - Request copy of adjuster's report
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What adjusters look for">
    - Cause of damage (covered peril or excluded cause)
    - Extent of damage
    - Pre-existing conditions
    - Maintenance issues
    - Repair vs replacement determination
    - Applicable coverage and limits
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="If you disagree">
    You don't have to accept adjuster's assessment.

    **Options:**

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Claim Settlements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Replacement cost settlements">
    Typically paid in two parts:

    **Initial payment:** Actual cash value (depreciated value) of damaged items or structure.

    **Recoverable depreciation:** Difference between ACV and replacement cost, paid after you complete repairs or replacements.

    Must actually replace items to receive full replacement cost.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Actual cash value settlements">
    Single payment based on depreciated value. No additional payment for actually replacing items.

    If your policy is ACV rather than replacement cost, this is the full settlement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mortgage lender involvement">
    For large claims, insurer may issue check payable to both you and your lender.

    **Lender will:**

    - Endorse check
    - May hold funds in escrow
    - Release funds as repairs progress
    - Require inspection before final release

    Process varies by lender. Contact them early to understand requirements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Depreciation holdback">
    Insurer withholds depreciation until repairs are complete. To recover:

    - Complete repairs
    - Submit receipts showing actual costs
    - Request recoverable depreciation payment

    Time limits apply. Check policy for deadline to claim recoverable depreciation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Supplemental claims">
    If repair costs exceed initial estimate, file supplemental claim.

    **Common reasons:**

    - Hidden damage discovered during repairs
    - Contractor costs higher than adjuster estimate
    - Code-required upgrades
    - Additional items found damaged

    Document additional damage and costs. Submit promptly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Disputes and Appeals

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Common dispute reasons">
    - Claim denied as not covered
    - Settlement amount too low
    - Depreciation calculations disputed
    - Cause of damage disputed
    - Coverage limits disagreement
    - Delay in processing
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Internal appeal">
    First step is appealing within the insurance company.

    - Request written denial explanation
    - Review policy language yourself
    - Provide additional documentation
    - Submit formal written appeal
    - Request supervisor review

    Document all communications.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="State insurance department">
    If internal appeal fails, contact state insurance commissioner.

    - File formal complaint
    - Department may investigate
    - Can mediate disputes
    - May find insurer violated regulations

    Not binding arbitration, but creates pressure for fair resolution.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Appraisal clause">
    Most policies include appraisal process for disputed amounts.

    - Each party hires appraiser
    - Appraisers select neutral umpire
    - Majority decision is binding

    Useful for amount disputes, not coverage disputes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hiring a public adjuster">
    Public adjusters work for you, not the insurer.

    **When to consider:**

    - Large or complex claims
    - Disputed claims
    - Feeling overwhelmed by process
    - Insurer offering low settlement

    **Cost:** Typically 5-15% of settlement. Negotiate fee before hiring.

    Can significantly increase settlements on large claims.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Legal action">
    If other options fail, lawsuit may be necessary.

    **Consider attorney if:**

    - Claim wrongfully denied
    - Settlement significantly below actual damages
    - Insurer acting in bad faith
    - Policy language is ambiguous

    Many attorneys offer free consultation for insurance disputes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Keep copies of all correspondence with your insurer. Written communication creates a record that protects your interests if disputes arise.
</Note>

## Impact on Premiums and Insurability

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Premium increases">
    Claims typically increase premiums at renewal.

    **Factors affecting increase:**

    - Type of claim (water claims often have biggest impact)
    - Claim amount
    - Number of prior claims
    - Time since last claim

    Increases can last 3-5 years after claim.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Claim-free discounts">
    Filing a claim eliminates claim-free discounts.

    If you've had discount for 5+ claim-free years, first claim costs both the increase and loss of discount.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Non-renewal risk">
    Multiple claims may result in insurer not renewing policy.

    **Higher risk of non-renewal:**

    - Two or more claims in 3 years
    - Water damage claims
    - Liability claims
    - Claims shortly after obtaining policy

    Non-renewal makes finding new coverage difficult and expensive.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CLUE report">
    Claims are reported to CLUE (Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange) database.

    - Claims follow you, not just the property
    - Other insurers see your claims history
    - Affects quotes from new insurers
    - Claims stay on report 5-7 years

    Request free copy of your CLUE report annually.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Claims that don't affect premiums">
    Some claims may not increase premiums:

    - Weather-related claims (in some states)
    - Claims where you weren't at fault
    - First claim with claim forgiveness feature
    - Inquiries that don't become formal claims

    Ask your insurer about their specific policies.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Waiting too long to report">
    Policies require prompt reporting. Waiting can result in denial.

    Report immediately, even if you're unsure about filing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Disposing of damaged items">
    Throwing away damaged items before adjuster inspection can result in denial.

    Keep everything until claim is fully settled.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not documenting thoroughly">
    Insufficient documentation weakens your claim.

    Take extensive photos and video before any repairs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Accepting first offer">
    Initial offers are often negotiable. Review carefully before accepting.

    Get independent estimates to compare.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not reading your policy">
    Understanding your coverage helps you know what to expect.

    Review policy before loss occurs. Know your deductibles, limits, and exclusions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Making permanent repairs too quickly">
    Emergency repairs are necessary, but permanent repairs should wait for adjuster inspection.

    Document everything and get approval before major work.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Exaggerating or misrepresenting">
    Inflating claims is fraud. Can result in claim denial, policy cancellation, and criminal charges.

    Be accurate and honest in all documentation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
