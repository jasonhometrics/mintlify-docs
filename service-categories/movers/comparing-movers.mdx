description: "Questions to ask and what to look for"
---

Choosing the right moving company requires comparing multiple options across several factors. Price is important but shouldn't be the only consideration. Reliability, professionalism, and protection matter equally.

Systematic comparison helps identify the best mover for your situation.

## What to Compare

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Licensing and registration">
    Verify legal operation:
    
    **Interstate moves:**
    - Valid USDOT number
    - Active MC authority
    - Insurance on file with FMCSA
    
    **Local moves:**
    - State licensing (where required)
    - Business registration
    - Local permits
    
    Don't hire unlicensed movers regardless of price.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Experience and track record">
    Consider company history:
    
    - Years in business
    - Number of moves completed
    - Complaint history

    - Online reviews
    
    Newer companies aren't necessarily bad, but track record provides confidence.

    - Hourly vs weight-based

    - Basic coverage included
    - Full value protection cost
    - Deductible options

    Better coverage may justify higher price.

## Evaluating Estimates

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Comparing fairly">
    Ensure estimates cover same services:
    
    - Same origin and destination details
    - Same inventory of items
    - Same packing services (or lack of)
    - Same valuation coverage
    - Same delivery timeline
    
    Different scope makes comparison meaningless.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Understanding differences">
    If estimates vary significantly, ask why:
    
    - Different weight/time estimates?
    - Different services included?
    - Different valuation coverage?
    - Different delivery timeline?
    - Different company overhead/quality?
    
    Lowest price isn't always best value.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Total cost vs base cost">
    Look at complete picture:
    
    - Base transportation
    - Packing services
    - Special handling
    - Valuation coverage
    - Fees and surcharges
    - Payment terms
    
    Low base with high add-ons may exceed higher base with inclusions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
The best mover isn't always the cheapest. Consider the total package: licensing, reputation, services, protection, and price together.
</Note>

## Reading Reviews

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where to look">
    Check multiple sources:
    
    - Google reviews
    - Yelp
    - Better Business Bureau
    - FMCSA complaint database
    - Angi/HomeAdvisor
    - Facebook
    
    Single source may be incomplete or manipulated.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What to look for">
    **Positive signs:**
    - Consistent praise across sources
    - Specific details in reviews
    - Responses to negative reviews
    - Recent reviews (within 6-12 months)
    - Variety of reviewers
    
    **Warning signs:**
    - Only extreme reviews (all 5-star or all 1-star)
    - Generic, similar language
    - All reviews from same time period
    - No responses to complaints
    - Reviewer profiles look fake
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Understanding negative reviews">
    Every company has some complaints. Consider:
    
    - Volume relative to positive reviews
    - How company responds
    - Whether issues were resolved
    - Patterns in complaints
    - Severity of issues
    
    One bad review isn't disqualifying. Patterns are concerning.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Weighting factors">
    Prioritize based on your situation:
