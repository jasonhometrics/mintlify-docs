Home staging is the process of preparing a property for sale by arranging furniture, decor, and accessories to highlight the home's best features and help potential buyers envision themselves living there. Staging can involve rearranging existing furnishings, bringing in rented furniture, or digitally adding furniture to photos.

Staging is a marketing strategy used to make properties more appealing in listing photos and during showings.

## Why Staging Matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Helps buyers visualize">
    Empty rooms can be difficult for buyers to envision as living spaces. Staged homes help buyers understand room scale, furniture placement possibilities, and how spaces function.
    
    According to the National Association of Realtors, 81% of buyers' agents say staging makes it easier for clients to visualize a property as their future home.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Improves listing photos">
    Most home searches begin online. Properties with furnished, professionally photographed rooms generate more interest than empty or cluttered spaces.
    
    Staged listings tend to receive more views, more showing requests, and more engagement on listing platforms.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="May increase sale price">
    Research suggests staged homes often sell for more than unstaged comparable properties. The Real Estate Staging Association reports that staged homes may sell for 5% to 15% more than unstaged homes.
    
    Results vary by market, price point, and staging quality.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="May reduce time on market">
    Staged homes tend to sell faster than unstaged homes. Properties that photograph well and show well typically generate offers more quickly.
    
    Faster sales reduce carrying costs (mortgage, utilities, insurance) and allow sellers to move on sooner.
  </Accordion>

## What Staging Involves

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Consultation and planning">
    Stagers assess the property and develop a plan:
    
    - Walk through property with seller/agent
    - Identify strengths to highlight
    - Note areas needing attention
    - Recommend staging approach
    - Provide cost estimate
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Preparation">
    Before staging, properties often need:
    
    - Decluttering and depersonalizing
    - Deep cleaning
    - Minor repairs
    - Paint touch-ups
    - Landscaping and curb appeal improvements
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Furniture and decor">
    Staging involves arranging furnishings to showcase spaces:
    
    - Furniture placement for flow and function
    - Artwork and accessories
    - Lighting adjustments
    - Textiles (rugs, pillows, bedding)
    - Plants and greenery
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Photography ready">
    Staging is typically completed before professional listing photos:
    
    - Staged rooms photographed for MLS and marketing
    - Photos used online, in print materials, and social media
    - Staging remains in place for showings
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
