Visibility on Hometrics reflects confidence. Our platform surfaces businesses that demonstrate consistent service quality, reliable reputation signals, and clear, complete information. Visibility is earned, not assigned.

  <Accordion title="Long gaps in activity">
    Businesses with months between reviews appear inactive or inconsistent. Regular activity signals ongoing operations and customer engagement.

    Missing information creates uncertainty. Customers skip profiles that lack basic details like photos, services, or contact methods.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Slow response times">
    Ignored inquiries or slow follow-through signal low prioritization of customer engagement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unclaimed profiles">
    Unclaimed profiles rank lower and miss opportunities for visibility improvements.

## Automated Review Generation (Growth Plan)

Growth adds automated review systems that build your Google reputation consistently. More Google reviews improve your visibility in Google search results, Google Maps, and across the web, not just on Hometrics.

**Why this matters:** Consistent review generation is a marketing best practice. Businesses with steady review momentum rank higher in Google search, appear more credible to customers, and earn more trust. Automation ensures you maintain that momentum without manual effort.

## Comprehensive Reputation Management (Authority Plan)

Authority includes everything in Growth plus full reputation management across major platforms. This keeps your business information consistent, suppresses duplicate listings, and ensures professional engagement with all reviews.

**Why this matters:** Inconsistent business information across platforms (Google, Yelp, directories) confuses search engines and customers. When your Name, Address, and Phone (NAP) vary across listings, Google may not recognize them as the same business. This splits your authority and reduces visibility.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Everything in Growth" icon="check">
    All automated review features plus the services below.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Listings management" icon="list">
    Business information kept accurate across 50+ major directories and platforms.
  </Card>
  <Card title="NAP consistency" icon="circle-check">
    Name, Address, Phone standardized everywhere so search engines recognize you as one business.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Duplicate listing suppression" icon="copy">
    Duplicate profiles identified and suppressed to consolidate your online presence.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review response management" icon="comment">

  <Card title="GBP optimization" icon="building">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Priority support" icon="headset">
