# What is Hometrics

## How Reviews Work

### Google Review Integration

All reviews displayed on Hometrics come from Google Business Profiles. Reviews are not hosted on the platform but are aggregated from Google's verified review system.

This approach maintains review authenticity because:
- Google applies verification and monitors manipulation
- Reviews cannot be selectively hidden or displayed
- Review dates and content remain publicly visible
- Negative reviews appear alongside positive ones

### Performance Badges

Some profiles display badges indicating specific performance patterns. These badges are algorithmically assigned based on review volume, consistency, and response behavior.

### Ranking and Visibility

Search results rank profiles based on review ratings, total review volume, and review recency. Professionals cannot pay to boost placement or hide negative feedback.

## How Search Works

## How Messaging Works

### Initial Contact

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send a message">
    Contact professionals directly through the platform without sharing email or phone number.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive responses">
    Professionals reply through the platform. Conversations remain private until contact information is shared.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share details when ready">
    Provide phone number or email address when comfortable scheduling consultations or moving forward.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Messaging prevents immediate sales calls and email sequences that typically follow traditional contact forms.
</Note>

### Contacting Multiple Professionals

The platform supports simultaneous conversations with multiple providers. Compare responses, ask follow-up questions, and evaluate communication styles before sharing contact information.

This enables the Rule of Three approach where interviewing at least three options in each service category provides comparison data and identifies patterns.

## Why This Matters

### Centralized Research

Real estate transactions require coordination among multiple service providers. Researching agents, lenders, title companies, attorneys, inspectors, insurance providers, and other professionals separately consumes significant time.

Hometrics centralizes this research in a single searchable directory. Compare options across all service categories without visiting multiple websites or review platforms.

### Verification of Recommendations

Real estate agents and other professionals typically recommend specific service providers based on established referral relationships. These recommendations may reflect convenience and familiarity rather than comprehensive market comparison.

Independent research allows verification that recommended professionals maintain strong track records and comparison against alternative options.

### Information Control

Traditional contact forms require sharing email addresses and phone numbers before receiving any information. This triggers immediate outreach from sales teams across multiple channels.

Platform messaging allows information gathering and initial evaluation while maintaining privacy. Share contact details only when ready to schedule consultations or move forward with specific professionals.
