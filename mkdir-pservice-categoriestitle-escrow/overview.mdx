# Title & Escrow Companies

<Note>
Title companies serve three roles: they verify you're buying property with clear legal ownership, hold your money in escrow until closing, and protect you from fraud. They're the financial quarterback of your transaction.
</Note>

## What They Do

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Title Search & Verification" icon="magnifying-glass">
    They examine public records to confirm the seller legally owns the property and has the right to sell it. This search identifies liens, judgments, unpaid taxes, or ownership disputes that could affect your purchase.
    
    If the title isn't clear, the sale can't proceed until issues are resolved.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Escrow Services" icon="hand-holding-dollar">
    They hold your earnest money deposit (typically 1-3% of purchase price) in a neutral account until closing. At closing, they coordinate the exchange of funds and documents between all parties.
    
    Your down payment, loan proceeds, and seller's payoff all flow through the title company at closing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Title Insurance" icon="shield-check">
    They issue insurance protecting you and your lender from title defects discovered after purchase: forged documents, unknown heirs claiming ownership, recording errors, or liens that weren't found during the title search.
    
    This is a one-time premium paid at closing, not an annual policy.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Settlement & Closing" icon="file-signature">
    They prepare closing documents, coordinate signing, ensure all funds are properly distributed, and record the deed with local government to establish your legal ownership.
    
    A licensed settlement agent walks you through every document you sign.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Why This Matters

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="They Hold Your Money" icon="vault">
    Your earnest money deposit (often $10K-$50K) sits in their escrow account for 30-60 days. If they're incompetent or uninsured, you're exposed.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Wire Fraud Target" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Wire fraud in real estate cost buyers $350M+ in 2023. Criminals hack email and send fake wiring instructions. The title company's security protocols are your primary defense.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Title Defects Are Costly" icon="scale-unbalanced">
    Without title insurance, you're personally liable if someone challenges your ownership years later. Legal defense alone can cost tens of thousands.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="They Control Timeline" icon="clock">
    Title search delays, documentation errors, or coordination failures can push back your closing date, costing you time and money.

<Warning>
Most buyers choose whoever their agent recommends without asking a single question. That's a mistake when this company controls your largest financial transaction.
</Warning>

## When You Need Them

<Steps>
  <Step title="Before Going Under Contract (Ideal)">
    Research and select your title company before writing an offer. Some contracts require you to wire earnest money within 3 business days—not enough time to vet options properly.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Within 3 Days of Contract (Reality)">
    Most buyers choose during this window. Move quickly: review their wire fraud insurance, security protocols, and who handles your closing before wiring funds.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Never">
    Don't wait until the week before closing. By then you've already wired your deposit and committed to their services.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Scenarios

**Buyer Using Financed Purchase:**
- Lender requires title insurance (protects their loan)
- You should also get owner's policy (protects your ownership)
- Title company coordinates with lender on all closing documents

**Cash Buyer:**
- Still need title search and title insurance
- Process is faster (no lender involvement)
- Owner's policy is optional but strongly recommended

**Inherited or Probate Property:**
- More complex title search
- May require estate attorney involvement
- Longer timeline to clear title
