## See What You Need to Know

### Profile Information

Each profile displays publicly available information from Google Business Profiles:

- Business name and address
- Phone number and website
- Business hours
- Services offered
- Google review rating (star average)
- Total number of reviews
- Individual customer reviews with dates
- Performance badges (when earned)

### Review Display

Reviews come directly from Google Business Profiles. We pull them in real-time, so you see the same reviews that appear on Google Maps and Google Search.

What this means for you:
- All reviews are visible (positive and negative)
- Review dates show when feedback was actually posted
- Businesses can't hide or remove reviews through our platform
- Google's verification system catches fake reviews

### Performance Badges

Some profiles display [badges](/overview/badges) indicating consistent performance patterns. These badges are assigned automatically based on review activity:

- **Trending**: Recent surge in positive reviews
- **Top Rated**: Consistently high ratings with regular reviews
- **Local Legend**: Long-term presence with sustained positive feedback
- **Fast Responder**: Quick response to messages (80%+ within 4 hours)

Badges are earned through actual customer feedback and platform activity, not purchased or awarded for payment.

## Connect on Your Terms

### Private Messaging

Contact professionals directly through the platform without sharing your contact information:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a conversation">
    Send your question or request through the message button on any profile. No email or phone number required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get replies in your inbox">
    Professionals respond through the platform. You receive notifications and can reply directly in your message inbox.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share contact details when ready">
    Once you're comfortable moving forward, provide your phone number or email to schedule consultations or next steps.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why This Matters

Traditional contact forms require sharing email and phone before you learn anything about the professional. This triggers immediate calls, texts, and email sequences from sales teams.

Our messaging system lets you:
- Ask questions before committing to a phone call
- Evaluate communication style and response time
- Request quotes or availability without pressure
- Compare multiple professionals simultaneously

### Talking to Multiple Professionals

You can message several providers at once. Each conversation stays separate in your inbox. Compare their responses, response times, and communication approaches before deciding who to contact directly.

This supports the **Rule of Three**: get responses from at least three professionals in each category before making a decision. Three options give you enough data to spot patterns in pricing, approach, availability, and professionalism.

<Tip>
Message more than three if you're unsure. There's no limit on conversations, and you control when (or if) you share your contact information with each one.
