## What Makes This Different

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="No Gatekeeping">
    Every term is explained. Every process is broken down. Nothing assumes you already know how real estate works.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Consumer Advocate">
    This guide tells you what professionals don't always volunteer. Red flags. Questions they hope you don't ask. What "normal" actually costs.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Verification Over Trust">
    When you're ready to hire, the [Hometrics Directory](https://hometrics.com) shows you verified customer reviews, not just marketing claims.
