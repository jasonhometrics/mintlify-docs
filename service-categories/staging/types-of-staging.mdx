Staging services range from comprehensive furniture rental for empty homes to digital enhancements of listing photos. The right approach depends on property condition, budget, timeline, and market conditions.

Understanding the options helps sellers and agents choose the most effective staging strategy.

## Vacant Home Staging

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What it is">
    Full staging of an empty property using rented furniture, artwork, accessories, and decor. The stager transforms empty rooms into furnished, styled spaces.

    This is the most comprehensive (and typically most expensive) form of staging.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's included">
    Typical vacant staging includes:

    - Furniture for key rooms (living, dining, bedrooms)
    - Artwork and wall decor
    - Rugs and window treatments
    - Accessories (lamps, plants, books, decorative items)
    - Bedding and bathroom towels
    - Delivery, installation, and removal
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Timeline">
    - **Consultation:** 1-2 hours
    - **Planning and sourcing:** 1-2 weeks
    - **Installation:** 1 day for most homes
    - **Rental period:** Typically 30-90 days
    - **Removal:** 1 day after sale
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Best for">
    - Completely empty homes
    - New construction
    - Investor properties
    - Higher-priced homes where staging cost is proportionally small
    - Properties in competitive markets
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Occupied Home Staging

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What it is">
    Staging a home while the owner still lives there, using a combination of the owner's existing furniture and supplemental pieces brought in by the stager.

    Focus is on rearranging, editing, and enhancing rather than replacing everything.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's included">
    Typical occupied staging includes:

    - Decluttering recommendations
    - Furniture rearrangement
    - Removal of personal items
    - Addition of select accessories and artwork
    - Color and lighting recommendations
    - Shopping list for owner purchases (optional)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Process">
    - **Consultation:** Stager walks through with owner
    - **Recommendations:** Written or verbal guidance
    - **Implementation:** Owner makes changes or stager assists
    - **Hands-on staging:** Stager arranges and styles
    - **Photography:** Property photographed after staging
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Best for">
    - Homes where owner hasn't moved out yet
    - Properties with decent existing furniture
    - Budget-conscious sellers
    - Situations where full vacant staging isn't practical
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Partial Staging

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What it is">
    Staging only select rooms rather than the entire home. Focuses resources on highest-impact spaces.

    Often used when budget is limited or only key rooms need attention.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Common approach">
    Typical partial staging focuses on:

    - Living room
    - Primary bedroom
    - Kitchen (styling, not furniture)
    - Dining room

    Secondary bedrooms, bathrooms, and utility spaces may be left unstaged or minimally styled.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Best for">
    - Limited staging budgets
    - Properties where only some rooms need help
    - Situations where owner can stage some rooms themselves
    - Smaller homes where fewer rooms need attention
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Virtual Staging

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What it is">
    Digital enhancement of listing photos. Software is used to add furniture, artwork, and decor to photos of empty rooms.

    No physical furniture is involved. The staged images are used for online marketing only.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's included">
    - Digital furniture placement in photos
    - Various style options (modern, traditional, etc.)
    - High-resolution images for MLS and marketing
    - Quick turnaround (often 24-48 hours)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Typical costs">
    Virtual staging typically costs $20 to $75 per photo, depending on complexity and provider. This is significantly less than physical staging.

    A typical listing might require 5-10 virtually staged photos.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limitations">
    - Buyers see empty rooms at showing
    - Must disclose that photos are virtually staged
    - Doesn't help with in-person presentation
    - Quality varies significantly by provider
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Best for">
    - Very limited budgets
    - Properties where physical staging isn't practical
    - Vacant homes in lower price ranges
    - Supplementing physical staging of key rooms
    - Quick listings where time doesn't allow physical staging
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Consultation Only

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What it is">
    Stager provides professional advice without hands-on staging services. The seller implements recommendations themselves.

    This is the most affordable option for those willing to do the work.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's included">
    - Walk-through of property
    - Room-by-room recommendations
    - Written report or checklist
    - Shopping suggestions
    - Paint color recommendations
    - Furniture arrangement guidance
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Typical costs">
    Staging consultations typically cost \$150 - \$600, depending on home size and market.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Best for">
    - DIY-oriented sellers
    - Budget-conscious situations
    - Homes needing minor improvements
    - Sellers who want professional guidance but can execute themselves
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Comparing Staging Types

| Type          | Cost Level | Physical Staging | Best For                               |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Vacant (full) | Highest    | Yes              | Empty homes, higher price points       |
| Occupied      | Moderate   | Yes              | Lived-in homes with existing furniture |
| Partial       | Moderate   | Yes              | Limited budget, key rooms only         |
| Virtual       | Lowest     | No               | Online marketing only                  |
| Consultation  | Lowest     | No               | DIY sellers wanting guidance           |

## Choosing the Right Approach

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Consider your budget">
    Staging costs vary widely. Determine what you can spend, then work backward to find the best option within that budget.

    Even consultation-only or virtual staging is better than no staging for most properties.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider your timeline">
    Physical staging requires planning time for furniture sourcing and installation. Virtual staging can be completed in days.

    If listing quickly, virtual or consultation-only may be more practical.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider buyer expectations">
    In higher-end markets, buyers expect polished presentation. In competitive markets, staging helps properties stand out.

    Talk to your real estate agent about what's typical in your area and price range.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider property condition">
    Homes with good bones but empty rooms benefit from vacant staging. Homes with dated furniture may need more intervention than occupied staging can provide.

    A professional consultation can help determine the best approach.
