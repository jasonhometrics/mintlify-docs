Understanding appraisals helps property owners and buyers navigate transactions where value determination is critical.

## Why Appraisals Matter

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Lender protection">
    Lenders require appraisals to ensure the property is worth at least the loan amount. If the borrower defaults, the lender needs confidence they can recover their investment through sale.

    Without appraisals, lenders would be lending against unknown collateral value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Buyer protection">
    Appraisals prevent buyers from overpaying based on inflated asking prices or emotional attachment. An independent third party confirms the property's value aligns with the purchase price.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transaction foundation">
    Appraisals establish the value that determines loan amounts, down payment requirements, PMI thresholds, and whether deals can proceed as structured.

    A low appraisal can change or kill a transaction. A high appraisal confirms the deal makes financial sense.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Legal and financial decisions">
    Beyond purchases, appraisals inform:

    - Estate distribution among heirs
    - Divorce asset division
    - Property tax appeals
    - Insurance coverage amounts
    - Donation valuations
    - Partnership buyouts
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When Appraisals Are Required

**Always required:**

- Conventional mortgage purchases
- FHA, VA, and USDA loans
- Most refinances
- Home equity loans and HELOCs (usually)

**Often required:**

- Estate settlement and probate
- Divorce proceedings
- Property tax appeals
- Charitable donations of real estate
- Business valuations involving real property

**Optional but valuable:**

- Pre-listing (to price accurately)
- For sale by owner transactions
- Investment analysis
- Insurance coverage review
- Settling disputes

## What Appraisers Do

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Property inspection">
    Appraisers physically visit the property to assess:

    - Size and layout
    - Condition and quality
    - Features and amenities
    - Updates and improvements
    - Functional issues
    - External factors (location, views, noise)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Market research">
    Appraisers analyze recent sales of comparable properties:

    - Similar size and style
    - Same neighborhood or comparable area
    - Recent sales (typically within 6 months)
    - Similar condition and features

    Adjustments are made for differences between comparables and subject property.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Value conclusion">
    Using inspection findings and market data, appraiser develops opinion of value.

    Most residential appraisals use the sales comparison approach, weighing comparable sales to determine what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Report preparation">
    Findings are documented in standardized report format:

    - Property description
    - Neighborhood analysis
    - Comparable sales data
    - Adjustment explanations
    - Photos and maps
    - Final value opinion
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Appraiser Independence

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why independence matters">
    Appraisers must be independent to provide reliable valuations. Inflated appraisals contributed to the 2008 financial crisis when values were overstated to make deals work.

    Independence protects buyers, lenders, and the broader financial system.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regulatory requirements">
    Federal regulations (Dodd-Frank Act, FIRREA) require:

    - Appraisers cannot be selected by loan officers or real estate agents
    - Compensation cannot be tied to property value or loan approval
    - No one can pressure appraiser to hit specific value
    - Appraisal Management Companies (AMCs) create separation between lenders and appraisers
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who orders the appraisal">
    For mortgage transactions, lenders order appraisals through AMCs or approved appraiser panels. Borrowers pay but don't select the appraiser.

    For private appraisals (estate, divorce, pre-listing), property owners can select their own appraiser.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Attempting to influence an appraiser's value conclusion is illegal. Providing factual information about the property (recent improvements, comparable sales) is appropriate. Pressuring for a specific number is not.
</Note>
