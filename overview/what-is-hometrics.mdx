## Reviews

All reviews come from Google Business Profiles. We pull them directly from Google's system, so you see the same reviews that appear on Google Maps and Google Search.

This means reviews can't be hidden, negative feedback appears alongside positive, and Google monitors for fakes.

Some profiles display [badges](/overview/badges) for consistent performance patterns. These are assigned automatically based on review data, not paid placements.

## Messaging

Contact professionals without sharing your email or phone number:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send your question">
    Message any professional directly. No contact info required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get responses">
    Professionals reply through the platform. Check your inbox for notifications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share contact details when ready">
    Provide your phone or email once you're comfortable moving forward.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can message multiple professionals at once. Compare their responses, response times, and communication style before deciding who to contact directly.

<Tip>
  **Rule of Three**: Message at least three professionals in each category. Three responses give you enough data to spot patterns in pricing, approach, and professionalism.
