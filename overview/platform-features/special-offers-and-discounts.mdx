## How Discounts Work

**Eligibility verification** varies by business and discount type. Some require documentation at time of service, others verify during initial contact. Confirm verification requirements when requesting quotes.

**Discount amounts** are set individually by each business. Discounts may be percentage-based, fixed dollar amounts, or service upgrades at no additional cost.

**Stackability** depends on business policy. Some allow combining multiple discounts, others apply only one discount per transaction.

**Service restrictions** may apply. Discounts might exclude certain services, apply only to specific transaction types, or have minimum purchase requirements.

## Finding Businesses with Special Pricing

Use discount filters when searching to display only businesses offering specific discount types. Combine discount filters with other search criteria like location, service type, and ratings.

Discount availability does not indicate service quality. Evaluate businesses based on customer reviews, credentials, and service offerings in addition to discount eligibility.
