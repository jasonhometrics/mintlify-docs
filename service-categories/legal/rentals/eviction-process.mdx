Eviction is the legal process for removing tenants from rental property. Landlords must follow specific procedures established by state and local law. Shortcuts or "self-help" methods are illegal and expose landlords to liability.

The process varies by jurisdiction but follows a general pattern.

## Grounds for Eviction

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Non-Payment of Rent">
    Most common eviction reason. Landlord must typically provide written notice and opportunity to pay before filing.

    Notice periods vary from 3-14 days depending on jurisdiction.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lease Violations">
    Breaking lease terms such as unauthorized pets, excessive noise, unauthorized occupants, or property damage.

    Usually requires written notice and opportunity to cure (fix the violation) before eviction can proceed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Illegal Activity">
    Drug activity, violence, or other crimes on the property. May allow expedited eviction with shorter or no cure period.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lease Expiration">
    Tenant remains after lease ends without renewal. Requires proper notice that lease will not be renewed.

    In "just cause" jurisdictions, landlords may need specific reasons even at lease end.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Owner Move-In or Major Renovation">
    Some jurisdictions allow eviction if owner intends to occupy or substantially renovate. Often requires relocation assistance.

## Eviction Timeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Notice to tenant">
    Written notice specifying violation and required action. Type and length depend on reason (pay or quit, cure or quit, unconditional quit).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Waiting period">
    Tenant has time to comply (pay rent, fix violation, or vacate). Ranges from 3-30 days depending on reason and jurisdiction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filing with court">
    If tenant doesn't comply, landlord files eviction lawsuit (often called "unlawful detainer" or "summary process").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Court hearing">
    Both parties appear before judge. Tenant can present defenses. Hearing typically scheduled 1-4 weeks after filing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Judgment">
    If landlord prevails, court issues judgment for possession and possibly back rent and costs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Writ of possession">
    If tenant still doesn't leave, landlord obtains writ authorizing sheriff to remove tenant. Additional 5-14 days typical.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Total timeline:** 3-8 weeks in most cases. Can extend significantly if tenant contests or court backlogs exist.

## Tenant Defenses

Tenants can fight evictions on various grounds.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Improper Notice">
    Wrong notice type, insufficient time, improper delivery, or missing information can invalidate eviction.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Retaliation">
    Eviction following tenant's exercise of legal rights (reporting code violations, requesting repairs) may be retaliatory and prohibited.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Discrimination">
    Eviction based on protected class status violates Fair Housing Act.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Habitability Failures">
    Landlord's failure to maintain habitable conditions may defend against eviction, particularly for non-payment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Acceptance of Rent">
    Landlord accepting rent after violation may waive right to evict for that violation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Payment Made">
    For non-payment cases, proof that rent was paid or tendered within notice period.
  </Accordion>
