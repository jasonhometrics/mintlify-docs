description: "Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act protections for homebuyers and borrowers"
---

The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) is a federal law that governs real estate settlement services. It requires lenders and settlement service providers to give borrowers timely disclosures about loan costs, prohibits kickbacks and referral fees, and limits escrow account requirements.

RESPA applies to most residential mortgage loans, including purchases, refinances, and home equity loans.

## Who RESPA Protects

RESPA protects consumers in transactions involving:

- Purchase loans for 1-4 family residential properties
- Refinances of existing residential mortgages
- Home equity loans and lines of credit
- Reverse mortgages
- Loans secured by manufactured homes

RESPA does not apply to:
- Loans for business or commercial purposes
- Temporary financing (construction loans)
- Loans on properties larger than 25 acres

## Key Protections

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Right to Choose Service Providers">
    Borrowers have the right to choose their own settlement service providers, including:
    
    - Title insurance companies
    - Escrow/settlement agents
    - Attorneys
    - Home inspectors
    - Homeowners insurance
    
    Lenders may require title insurance but cannot require a specific provider. Lenders can provide a list of recommended providers but must allow borrowers to choose alternatives.
    
    **Exception:** Lenders can require use of specific providers if they pay for the service.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Loan Estimate Disclosure">
    Within 3 business days of receiving a loan application, lenders must provide a Loan Estimate detailing:
    
    - Interest rate and monthly payment
    - Total closing costs
    - Estimated cash needed to close
    - Loan terms and features
    - Projected payments over time
    
    The Loan Estimate allows borrowers to compare offers from multiple lenders before committing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Closing Disclosure">
    At least 3 business days before closing, borrowers must receive a Closing Disclosure showing:
    
    - Final loan terms
    - Actual closing costs
    - How costs compare to the Loan Estimate
    - Cash needed at closing
    
    The 3-day waiting period allows time to review and question discrepancies. Changes to certain loan terms reset the waiting period.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Escrow Account Limits">
    RESPA limits how much lenders can require in escrow accounts for taxes and insurance:
    
    - Monthly deposits limited to 1/12 of annual costs
    - Maximum cushion of 2 months' worth of payments
    - Annual escrow analysis required
    - Surplus over $50 must be refunded
    
    Borrowers can request escrow account statements to verify accuracy.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Servicing Transfer Notices">
    When mortgage servicing is transferred to a new company:
    
    - Current servicer must notify borrower at least 15 days before transfer
    - New servicer must notify borrower within 15 days after transfer
    - 60-day grace period during which late fees cannot be charged for payments sent to wrong servicer
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Prohibited Practices

RESPA prohibits certain practices that increase costs or limit consumer choice.

<Warning>
**Kickbacks and Referral Fees**

RESPA prohibits giving or receiving anything of value for referrals of settlement service business. This includes:

- Cash payments for referrals
- Gifts, trips, or entertainment
- Fee splits with parties not providing services
- Discounts conditioned on referrals

Violations can result in fines up to $10,000 and imprisonment up to 1 year.
</Warning>

**Unearned Fees**
No one can charge fees for services not actually performed. Fee splitting is only permitted when each party provides actual services.

**Requiring Specific Providers**
Sellers cannot require buyers to use a specific title insurance company. Lenders cannot require specific settlement providers unless they pay for the service.

**Inflated Fees**
Service providers cannot charge more than the reasonable value of services performed.

## Affiliated Business Arrangements (AfBAs)

Real estate professionals often have ownership interests in related businesses (a real estate brokerage owning a title company, for example). These arrangements are legal under RESPA if:

**Disclosure is provided**
Written disclosure of the business relationship must be given at or before referral.

**No required use**
Consumers cannot be required to use the affiliated business.

**Only legitimate payments**
The affiliated business can only receive payment for services actually performed, not for referrals.

<Note>
When receiving a referral to a title company, lender, or other service provider, ask: "Do you have any ownership interest or business relationship with this company?" Providers are required to disclose these relationships, but asking directly ensures transparency.
</Note>

## Tolerance Limits on Closing Costs

RESPA limits how much actual closing costs can exceed the Loan Estimate:

**Zero tolerance (cannot increase):**
- Lender fees (origination, underwriting)
- Transfer taxes
- Fees for services where lender selected the provider

**10% tolerance (total can increase up to 10%):**
- Title services and insurance (if borrower uses lender's list)
- Recording fees
- Other services borrower cannot shop for

**No limit:**
- Services borrower shopped for independently
- Prepaid interest
- Property insurance premiums

If costs exceed tolerance limits, lenders must refund the difference at closing or within 30 days.
