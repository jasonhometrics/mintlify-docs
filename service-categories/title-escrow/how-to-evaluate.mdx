# How to Evaluate Title & Escrow Companies

Evaluating title and escrow companies means assessing their security protocols, insurance coverage, experience, and closing procedures before selecting one for a transaction.

The company selected handles significant funds and verifies legal ownership details. Their protocols directly impact transaction security and success. Most parties accept referrals without verification, creating unnecessary risk.

## What to Evaluate

**Security and fraud protection** - Wire fraud targets all transaction participants. Companies need encrypted communication, verification protocols, and insurance coverage.

**Settlement staff** - Some companies outsource to notaries who witness signatures. Others employ settlement agents/attorneys who can explain documents and answer questions.

**Local experience** - Companies embedded in local markets understand county-specific requirements, recording procedures, and common title issues.

**Fee transparency** - Costs vary significantly between companies. Clear breakdowns show who pays what.

## Essential Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Security and Wire Fraud Protection">
    **"What security measures protect wire transfers?"**

    Look for:

    - Encrypted portals for document sharing and wire instructions
    - Phone verification protocols using independently verified numbers
    - Multi-factor authentication for account access
    - Staff training on fraud prevention

    **"Do you carry wire fraud insurance? What's the coverage amount?"**

    Insurance protects transactions if funds are stolen due to security breaches. Companies without coverage pass all risk to clients.

    **"How do you communicate wire instructions?"**

    Best practice: Secure portal delivery with mandatory phone verification. Red flag: Email-only communication.

    **"Have you had any wire fraud incidents? How were they resolved?"**

    Companies should answer transparently. Zero incidents may indicate strong security, low volume, or unreported problems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Experience and Track Record">
    **"How many closings do you handle monthly?"**

    Volume indicates experience with various scenarios. Companies closing 50+ transactions monthly have seen most complications and resolution methods.

    **"How long have you operated in this market?"**

    Local experience matters. Companies familiar with county recording offices, local title issues, and regional customs prevent delays.

    **"What percentage of your closings occur on the scheduled date?"**

    On-time closing rates above 95% indicate reliable processes and experienced coordination.

    **"Can you provide references from recent transactions?"**

    Request contact information for 2-3 recent clients. Ask about communication, problem-solving, and surprises encountered.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Settlement and Closing Procedures">
    **"Who conducts the closing? A licensed settlement agent or a notary?"**

    Licensed settlement agents can explain documents, answer legal questions, and provide guidance. Notaries witness signatures only.

    **"What happens if questions arise during closing?"**

    Settlement agents resolve issues immediately. Notaries cannot provide answers, delaying resolution.

    **"Are evening or weekend closings available?"**

    Flexibility accommodates parties with scheduling constraints. Limited availability may force inconvenient timing.

    **"What documents will I review before closing day?"**

    Best practice: Settlement statements and closing documents available 24-48 hours in advance for review.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Title Research and Insurance">
    **"What's included in your title search?"**

    Comprehensive searches review:

    - Ownership history (typically 30-60 years)
    - Outstanding liens and judgments
    - Unpaid taxes and assessments
    - Easements and restrictions
    - Legal descriptions and surveys

    **"How do you handle title defects discovered before closing?"**

    Experienced companies resolve most issues (paying off liens, obtaining releases, correcting errors) without delaying closing.

    **"What title insurance options do you offer?"**

    Standard coverage protects against defects in public records. Enhanced coverage adds protection for survey issues, building permit violations, and post-policy forgery.

    **"What's your claims process if title issues arise after closing?"**

    Understand response time, documentation requirements, and dispute resolution procedures.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Communication and Accessibility">
    **"Who is my main point of contact throughout the transaction?"**

    Single point of contact ensures continuity. Multiple handoffs increase miscommunication risk.

    **"How quickly do you respond to questions?"**

    Same-day response during business hours is standard. Next-day response acceptable for non-urgent matters.

    **"How do you keep parties updated on transaction progress?"**

    Proactive communication (weekly updates, milestone notifications) prevents surprises and reduces stress.

    **"What happens if problems arise outside business hours?"**

    Know who to contact and expected response time for urgent issues.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fees and Costs">
    **"Can you provide a detailed fee breakdown?"**

    Request itemized estimates including:

    - Title search fee
    - Title insurance premiums (lender's and owner's)
    - Settlement/closing fee
    - Document preparation
    - Recording fees
    - Wire transfer fees
    - Any additional charges

    **"Which fees are negotiable?"**

    Settlement fees and some service charges may be negotiable. Title insurance rates are often state-regulated.

    **"Are there circumstances where fees could increase?"**

    Understand potential additional costs (complex title issues, rush orders, amended documents).

    **"When is payment due?"**

    Most fees are paid at closing. Confirm no upfront costs required beyond standard deposits.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Red Flags vs Green Flags

<Warning>
  **Red Flags - Avoid companies that:**

  - Have no wire fraud insurance or won't disclose coverage
  - Cannot explain security protocols clearly
  - Send notaries instead of settlement agents to closings
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Green Flags - Look for companies that:**

  - Carry comprehensive wire fraud insurance
  - Use encrypted portals and phone verification
  - Employ licensed settlement agents for closings
</Tip>

## Comparing Multiple Companies

Research at least three companies before selecting one. Use this framework:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Schedule consultations with three companies">
    Request 20-30 minute calls or meetings. Ask the same questions to each for direct comparison.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request fee estimates for your specific transaction">
    Provide identical information (property address, purchase price, loan amount) to each company. Compare total costs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify insurance and licensing">
    Confirm wire fraud insurance coverage amounts. Verify settlement agents are properly licensed in your state.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Read reviews and check references">
    Focus on recent reviews mentioning security, communication, and problem resolution. Call provided references.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test responsiveness">
    Companies slow to respond during the sales process rarely improve once they have your business.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When to Start Research

Begin researching title companies before going under contract. Earnest money deposits are due within 3 business days of contract execution. This window is too short for proper evaluation.

Early research provides:

- Time to verify security protocols without pressure
- Ability to compare fees from multiple companies
- Opportunity to read reviews and check references
- Confidence when selecting during time-sensitive negotiations
