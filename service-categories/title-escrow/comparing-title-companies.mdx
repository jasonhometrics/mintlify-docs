title: "Comparing Title Companies"
description: "Questions to ask and how to evaluate title company options"
---

Comparing title companies means evaluating security protocols, experience, fees, and closing procedures before selecting one for a transaction. The company chosen handles significant funds and verifies legal ownership. Their protocols directly impact transaction security.

Researching options before going under contract allows time for proper evaluation. Once a contract is signed, earnest money is due within days.

## What to Compare

**Security protocols**
Wire fraud targets real estate transactions. Companies need encrypted communication, phone verification procedures, and insurance coverage.

**Experience and volume**
Companies handling high transaction volume have seen more scenarios and know how to resolve issues that arise.

**Who conducts closings**
Settlement agents and attorneys can answer questions. Notaries cannot. Confirm who will handle your closing.

**Communication and responsiveness**
Transactions move quickly. Responsiveness during initial contact indicates future service levels.

**Fees and transparency**
Costs vary between companies. Clear itemized breakdowns prevent surprises at closing.

## Essential Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Security">
    **"Do you carry wire fraud insurance?"**
    
    Companies without coverage pass all fraud risk to clients. Ask for coverage amounts.
    
    **"How do you communicate wire instructions?"**
    
    Secure portals with phone verification are standard. Email-only communication is a red flag.
    
    **"What security protocols protect fund transfers?"**
    
    Look for encrypted portals, multi-factor authentication, and staff training on fraud prevention.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Experience">
    **"How many closings do you handle monthly?"**
    
    Higher volume indicates exposure to various scenarios and established processes.
    
    **"How long have you operated in this area?"**
    
    Local experience means familiarity with county recording offices, common title issues, and regional practices.
    
    **"What percentage of closings occur on the scheduled date?"**
    
    On-time rates above 95% indicate reliable coordination.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Closing Procedures">
    **"Who will conduct my closing?"**
    
    Confirm whether it will be a settlement agent, attorney, or notary.
    
    **"Can they answer questions during signing?"**
    
    Attorneys and settlement agents can. Notaries cannot.
    
    **"Do you offer attorney settlements?"**
    
    Some companies provide this option. May be standard, optional, or not available.
    
    **"Are evening or weekend closings available?"**
    
    Flexibility accommodates scheduling constraints.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Fees">
    **"Can you provide an itemized fee breakdown?"**
    
    Request estimates including:
    - Settlement/closing fee
    - Title search fee
    - Title insurance premiums (owner's and lender's)
    - Document preparation
    - Recording fees
    - Wire transfer fees
    
    **"Which fees are negotiable?"**
    
    Settlement fees and some service charges may be negotiable. Title insurance rates are often state-regulated.
    
    **"Are there circumstances where fees could increase?"**
    
    Complex title issues, rush orders, or amended documents may add costs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Communication">
    **"Who will be my main contact?"**
    
    Single point of contact ensures continuity. Multiple handoffs increase miscommunication risk.

    Same-day response during business hours is standard.
    
    **"How do you keep parties updated on transaction progress?"**

    **"Which underwriters do you work with?"**
    
    Some title companies work with multiple underwriters, providing options.
    
    **"Do you offer reissue or refinance rates?"**
    
    Discounts may apply if a recent policy exists on the property.

## Red Flags vs Green Flags

<Warning>
**Red Flags:**

- No wire fraud insurance or won't disclose coverage
- Email-only communication for wire instructions
- Sends notaries instead of settlement agents without disclosure
- Vague answers about experience or security protocols
- Poor responsiveness during initial contact
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Green Flags:**

- Comprehensive wire fraud insurance
- Encrypted portals and phone verification procedures

- Responsive communication within hours
</Tip>

## Comparison Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify three companies to evaluate">
    Consider referrals from agents or lenders, but evaluate independently. Local reputation and reviews matter.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Request fee estimates">
    Provide identical property information to each company. Compare total costs, not just individual line items.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Ask security questions">
    Wire fraud insurance and secure communication protocols are non-negotiable. Confirm both.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clarify closing procedures">
    Confirm who conducts closings and their qualifications to answer questions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Evaluate responsiveness">
    How quickly did they respond? Communication patterns during initial contact indicate future service.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check reviews">
    Look for feedback on communication, closing experience, and problem resolution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When to Research

Begin researching title companies before making offers. Once a contract is signed, earnest money is due within 3 business days. This window is too short for proper evaluation.

Early research provides:
- Time to verify security protocols
- Opportunity to compare fees
- Ability to confirm closing procedures
- Confidence when wiring earnest money

## Making the Decision

After gathering information:

- Compare fee estimates side by side
- Confirm security protocols meet requirements
- Verify who conducts closings
- Consider responsiveness and communication quality
- Factor in local experience and reviews

The cheapest option is not always the best. Security protocols, closer qualifications, and reliable communication often matter more than small fee differences when significant funds and legal ownership are at stake.
