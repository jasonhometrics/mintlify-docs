title: "Using Differentiators Effectively"

Differentiators help customers compare similar providers more easily. They function as filters, not promises. Customers use differentiators to answer questions like: Who responds quickly? Who offers consultations? Who has experience with my situation?

## Differentiators and Trust

Differentiators work best when they reflect how a business actually operates. When differentiators align with real behavior, expectations are clearer, decisions happen faster, and reviews remain more consistent. When they don't align, trust erodes.

---

## Choosing Differentiators Intentionally

Before selecting a differentiator, ask:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can we support this consistently?">
    If a differentiator depends on exceptional effort or favorable circumstances, it's not sustainable. Select only what you can deliver reliably.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Would a customer notice if this were missing?">
    Effective differentiators reduce uncertainty for buyers. If removing it wouldn't change the customer experience, it's not adding value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does this reflect how we actually operate?">
    Differentiators should describe your normal operations, not aspirational goals or occasional exceptions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Clarity is more effective than quantity.

## Common High-Impact Differentiators

Impact varies by service type, but commonly influential differentiators include:

- Fast response time
- Weekend availability
- Free consultation
- Multilingual support
- Fraud or security protections (where applicable)

Only select differentiators you can reliably support.

---

## What to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Selecting every available differentiator">
    Over-selection dilutes impact and creates skepticism. Choose what genuinely distinguishes your operations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Selecting differentiators that depend on exceptional effort">
    If maintaining a differentiator requires heroic effort, it's not sustainable. Select only what your normal operations support.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Selecting differentiators that only apply occasionally">
    Differentiators should reflect consistent capabilities, not occasional exceptions. Inconsistent execution leads to inconsistent reviews.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Differentiators as Positioning

Differentiators signal how your business operates, not how it markets itself. They should answer: "What is it like to work with this business?"
