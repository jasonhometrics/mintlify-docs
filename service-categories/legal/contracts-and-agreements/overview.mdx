description: "Understanding the documents that govern real estate transactions"

Contracts define the terms of real estate transactions. Purchase contracts, lease agreements, and related documents create binding obligations for all parties.

Understanding contract components, common terms, and review practices helps protect interests and avoid costly mistakes.

## Why Contracts Matter

Real estate contracts are legally binding documents. Once signed, parties are obligated to perform according to the terms. Failure to perform can result in:

- Loss of earnest money deposits
- Legal liability for damages
- Forced completion of unfavorable terms
- Litigation costs

Reading and understanding contracts before signing is essential.

## Standard vs Custom Contracts

**Standard contracts**
Most residential transactions use standardized forms created by real estate associations or attorney groups. These forms:

- Include common provisions and protections
- Are familiar to agents, attorneys, and title companies
- Have been reviewed for legal compliance
- May favor one party or be relatively balanced

**Custom contracts**
Some transactions use custom-drafted contracts. These may be necessary for:

- Complex commercial transactions
- Unusual property types
- Non-standard terms
- Situations where standard forms don't fit

Custom contracts require careful legal review since they lack the familiarity and vetting of standard forms.

## Who Prepares Contracts

Contract preparation varies by transaction type and state:

**Residential sales:**
- Real estate agents typically prepare using standard forms
- Attorneys may prepare in attorney-required states
- FSBO sellers may use attorney-prepared contracts or standard forms

**Commercial transactions:**
- Attorneys typically draft or heavily modify contracts
- More negotiation of individual terms

**Leases:**
- Landlords or property managers typically provide
- Attorneys may prepare for commercial or complex situations
- Standard forms available for residential rentals

<Note>
Real estate agents can fill in blanks on standard forms but generally cannot draft custom contract language. Custom terms or unusual situations often warrant attorney involvement.

## Contract Basics

All real estate contracts share common elements:

**Parties**
Who is bound by the agreement. Must be legal entities or individuals with capacity to contract.

**Property description**
Clear identification of the property involved. Legal descriptions preferred over addresses for precision.

**Terms**
Price, dates, conditions, and obligations of each party.

**Consideration**
Something of value exchanged. In sales, typically the purchase price. In leases, rent payments.

**Signatures**
Contracts aren't binding until signed by all parties. Electronic signatures are valid in most situations.
