title: "Short Sales"
description: "Selling for less than mortgage balance"
---

A short sale occurs when a property sells for less than the amount owed on the mortgage. The lender agrees to accept the reduced proceeds as payment, forgiving some or all of the remaining balance.

Short sales are an alternative to foreclosure for homeowners who owe more than their home is worth.

## When Short Sales Make Sense

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Underwater mortgage">
    Property value has dropped below loan balance. Cannot sell without bringing cash to closing or lender approval for short sale.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Financial hardship">
    Owner can no longer afford payments due to job loss, medical issues, divorce, or other circumstances.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Foreclosure looming">
    Short sale may be better than foreclosure for credit impact and potential deficiency liability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No equity to sell traditionally">
    Selling costs (agent commission, closing costs) would exceed any equity. Lender must approve sale below payoff amount.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Short Sale vs Foreclosure

| Factor                         | Short Sale             | Foreclosure         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Credit impact                  | Less severe            | More severe         |
| Time on credit report          | 7 years                | 7 years             |
| Future mortgage waiting period | 2-4 years typically    | 3-7 years typically |
| Control over process           | More control           | No control          |
| Timeline                       | 3-12 months            | 2-24 months         |
| Deficiency judgment risk       | Varies (may be waived) | Higher risk         |

<Note>
  Short sales generally cause less credit damage than foreclosure because the account shows as settled rather than defaulted. However, both remain on credit reports for 7 years.
</Note>

## The Short Sale Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact lender">
    Notify mortgage servicer about hardship and interest in short sale. Request short sale package or application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document hardship">
    Gather required documentation: hardship letter, financial statements, tax returns, pay stubs, bank statements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="List property">
    Work with real estate agent experienced in short sales. Price based on market value, not loan balance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive offer">
    Buyer makes offer. Seller accepts subject to lender approval. Multiple offers may be submitted to lender.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit to lender">
    Complete short sale package submitted to lender's loss mitigation department. Includes offer, buyer qualifications, and seller documentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lender review">
    Lender evaluates whether short sale nets more than foreclosure. May order appraisal or BPO (broker price opinion).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approval or counter">
    Lender approves, rejects, or counters with different terms. May take weeks to months.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Close sale">
    Once approved, transaction closes like regular sale. Lender receives proceeds; remaining balance handled per approval terms.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Lender Approval Requirements

Lenders evaluate short sales based on whether they'll recover more than through foreclosure.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What lenders consider">
    - Property value vs loan balance
    - Foreclosure costs and timeline
    - Borrower's financial situation
    - Whether hardship is legitimate
    - Net proceeds from short sale vs foreclosure auction
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Common requirements">
    - Legitimate financial hardship
    - Property listed at fair market value
    - No fraud or misrepresentation
    - Arms-length transaction (no sale to family or related parties)
    - Borrower has made good faith effort to pay
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multiple lien holders">
    If second mortgage or HELOC exists, all lien holders must approve. Each wants maximum recovery. Negotiations can be complex.

    Second lien holders may require payment to release their lien, even from short sale proceeds.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Hardship Documentation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hardship letter">
    Written explanation of circumstances causing inability to pay. Include timeline of events, current situation, and why short sale is necessary.

    Be honest and specific. Generic letters are less effective.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Financial documents">
    Typically required:

    - Last 2 years tax returns
    - Recent pay stubs (last 30-60 days)
    - Last 2-3 months bank statements
    - List of monthly expenses
    - List of assets and liabilities
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Qualifying hardships">
    Common accepted hardships:

    - Job loss or reduced income
    - Medical expenses or disability
    - Divorce or separation
    - Death of income earner
    - Military deployment or PCS
    - Business failure
    - Unaffordable payment increase (ARM reset)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deficiency Balance

The deficiency is the difference between what's owed and what the property sells for.

**Example:** Owe \$300,000. Property sells for \$250,000. Deficiency is \$50,000.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Lender options">
    Lender may:

    - Waive deficiency entirely (full release)
    - Reserve right to collect deficiency
    - Accept partial payment of deficiency
    - Sell deficiency to collection agency
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Getting deficiency waived">
    Negotiate deficiency waiver as part of short sale approval. Get waiver in writing before closing.

    Approval letter should state "full satisfaction" or "waiver of deficiency" explicitly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="State law protections">
    Some states prohibit or limit deficiency judgments on primary residences. Others allow lenders to pursue full amount.

    Know your state's rules before proceeding.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Do not assume deficiency is waived. Get explicit written confirmation. If approval letter is silent or reserves rights, you may still owe the difference.
</Warning>

## Tax Implications

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Forgiven debt as income">
    IRS generally treats forgiven debt as taxable income. If lender forgives 50,000, that could be reported as income.

    Lender sends Form 1099-C for cancelled debt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Exclusions">
    Forgiven debt may be excluded from income if:

    - Debt was on primary residence (check current law)
    - Borrower was insolvent (liabilities exceeded assets)
    - Debt was discharged in bankruptcy

    Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act has been extended and modified over time. Verify current provisions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consult tax professional">
    Tax treatment is complex and law changes. Get professional advice before closing short sale to understand potential liability.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Timeline Expectations

Short sales are slow. Lender review creates delays.

**Typical timeline:**

- Listing to offer: 1-3 months
- Lender review: 1-4 months
- Approval to closing: 30-45 days
- Total: 3-12 months

**Factors affecting timeline:**

- Lender staffing and backlog
- Completeness of documentation
- Number of lien holders
- Property value disputes
- Buyer patience

<Note>
  Buyers often walk away during long approval processes. Short sale agents should set expectations with buyers about timeline uncertainty.
</Note>

## For Buyers

Buying a short sale can offer below-market prices but comes with challenges.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Advantages">
    - Potentially below-market price
    - Better condition than foreclosures (owner-occupied)
    - Less competition than traditional sales
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Disadvantages">
    - Long, uncertain timeline
    - Lender may reject or counter offer
    - Sold as-is in most cases
    - Seller cannot make repairs
    - Deposit tied up during approval
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tips for buyers">
    - Be patient and flexible
    - Don't count on closing by specific date
    - Get property inspected before lender approval (or accept risk)
    - Have backup options
    - Work with agent experienced in short sales
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
