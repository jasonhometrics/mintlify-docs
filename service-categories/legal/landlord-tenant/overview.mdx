## Legal Framework

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="State Law">
    Every state has landlord-tenant statutes covering security deposits, eviction procedures, habitability standards, and other core issues. These set baseline requirements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Local Ordinances">
    Cities and counties may add requirements beyond state law. Rent control, just-cause eviction, and additional tenant protections are common in some jurisdictions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lease Agreements">
    Contracts between landlords and tenants create additional rights and obligations. Lease terms cannot contradict applicable law.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Federal Law">
    Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination. Other federal laws apply in specific situations (lead paint disclosure, military tenant protections).

<Note>
  Laws vary dramatically by location. What's permitted in one state may be prohibited in another. Always verify requirements for your specific jurisdiction.

## Key Concepts

| Concept               | Meaning                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Habitability**      | Landlords must maintain livable conditions (plumbing, heating, electricity, structure). Cannot be waived. |
| **Quiet enjoyment**   | Tenants have right to peaceful possession without unreasonable landlord interference.                     |
| **Security deposits** | Regulated in most states with limits on amounts, holding requirements, and return timelines.              |
| **Eviction**          | Must follow legal process. Self-help eviction (changing locks, shutting utilities) is illegal everywhere. |
| **Retaliation**       | Landlords cannot punish tenants for exercising legal rights.                                              |

## When to Get Legal Help

**Landlords:** Eviction proceedings, lease drafting, fair housing compliance, tenant disputes heading to court.

**Tenants:** Wrongful eviction defense, unresolved habitability issues, discrimination claims, significant deposit disputes.

Many areas have tenant rights organizations offering free or low-cost assistance.
