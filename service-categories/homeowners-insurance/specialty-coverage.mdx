Standard homeowners insurance covers many risks but has gaps and limitations. Specialty coverage options fill those gaps, either through separate policies or endorsements added to your existing policy.

Understanding available options helps homeowners build comprehensive protection tailored to their specific risks and assets.

## Earthquake Insurance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why separate coverage is needed">
    Standard homeowners policies exclude earthquake damage. Earth movement of any kind is typically excluded:

    - Earthquake shaking
    - Landslide
    - Mudflow (sometimes covered by flood insurance)
    - Sinkholes
    - Earth sinking, rising, or shifting

    Even minor earthquakes can cause foundation cracks and structural damage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What it covers">
    Earthquake insurance covers damage from seismic activity:

    - Structural damage to home
    - Personal property damage
    - Additional living expenses
    - Other structures on property

    Coverage extends to fire resulting from earthquake, which standard policies may exclude if caused by earthquake.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who needs it">
    **Essential in:**

    - California
    - Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon)
    - Alaska
    - Parts of Midwest (New Madrid fault zone)
    - Areas with known seismic activity

    **Consider if:**

    - Home is older or not earthquake-retrofitted
    - Foundation type is vulnerable (raised foundation vs slab)
    - Cannot afford to self-insure earthquake loss
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How it's purchased">
    **Options:**

    - Endorsement to homeowners policy (not always available)
    - Separate earthquake policy
    - State programs (California Earthquake Authority)

    Availability and cost vary significantly by location and insurer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cost and deductibles">
    Earthquake insurance is expensive with high deductibles.

    **Deductibles:** Typically 10-20% of coverage amount (not a flat dollar amount)

    **Example:** 400,000 coverage with 15% deductible means \$60,000 out-of-pocket before insurance pays.

    **Premiums:** Vary widely based on location, construction type, age, and foundation.

    High deductibles mean coverage is for catastrophic damage, not minor cracks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="California Earthquake Authority">
    State-run program providing earthquake coverage to California homeowners.

    - Available through participating insurers
    - Standard policy forms
    - Various coverage and deductible options
    - Generally more affordable than private options

    Most California earthquake policies are through CEA.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Earthquake deductibles are percentage-based, not flat amounts. A 15% deductible on a \$500,000 policy means \$75,000 out-of-pocket. Ensure you understand this before purchasing.
</Note>

## Umbrella Insurance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What umbrella insurance does">
    Umbrella policy provides additional liability coverage beyond limits of homeowners and auto insurance.

    **Example:**

    - Homeowners liability: \$300,000
    - Auto liability: \$250,000
    - Umbrella policy: \$1,000,000

    If sued for \$800,000, homeowners pays first \$300,000, umbrella pays remaining \$500,000.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What it covers">
    - Personal injury liability (bodily injury to others)
    - Property damage liability
    - Legal defense costs
    - Certain claims excluded by underlying policies
    - Worldwide coverage

    Some umbrella policies cover additional risks like libel, slander, and defamation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What it doesn't cover">
    - Your own injuries or property damage
    - Business activities
    - Intentional acts
    - Criminal acts
    - Contractual liability
    - Workers compensation

    Umbrella is liability coverage only, not property coverage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who needs it">
    **Consider umbrella if:**

    - Net worth exceeds homeowners liability limit
    - Own rental properties
    - Have teenage drivers
    - Own pool, trampoline, or dog
    - Entertain frequently
    - Active lifestyle with injury risk
    - Serve on boards or volunteer
    - Higher profile in community

    Lawsuits can result in judgments far exceeding standard liability limits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How much coverage">
    **Common amounts:** \$1 million to \$5 million

    **General guidance:** Coverage should at least equal your net worth (assets minus liabilities).

    Consider future earning potential as well. Judgments exceeding insurance can garnish future wages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cost">
    Umbrella insurance is relatively inexpensive for coverage provided.

    **Typical costs:**

    - \$1 million coverage: \$150 to \$300 annually
    - \$2 million coverage: \$200 to \$400 annually
    - Each additional million: \$50 to \$100 annually

    Requires maintaining minimum liability limits on underlying homeowners and auto policies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Requirements">
    Umbrella policies require minimum underlying coverage:

    **Typical requirements:**

    - Homeowners liability: \$300,000+
    - Auto liability: \$250,000/\$500,000 or \$300,000 combined

    May need to increase underlying limits before umbrella is issued.

    Usually must have homeowners and auto with same insurer or through umbrella insurer.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Standard liability limits may be inadequate if you have significant assets. A serious injury lawsuit can result in judgments of 500,000 or more. Umbrella insurance protects assets beyond your home.
</Warning>

## Scheduled Personal Property

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why scheduling is needed">
    Standard homeowners policies have sub-limits for certain categories:

    | Category    | Typical Limit     |
    | ----------- | ----------------- |
    | Jewelry     | \$1,000 - \$2,000 |
    | Watches     | \$1,000 - 42,000  |
    | Furs        | \$2,000           |
    | Firearms    | \$2,000 - 3,000   |
    | Silverware  | \$2,500           |
    | Electronics | \$5,000           |
    | Cash        | \$200             |

    Items exceeding these limits need scheduling for full coverage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How scheduling works">
    Individual items are listed on policy with specific values.

    **Process:**

    - Identify items exceeding standard limits
    - Get appraisal for high-value items
    - Add items to policy with values
    - Pay additional premium for coverage

    Scheduled items are covered for their stated value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What to schedule">
    **Commonly scheduled:**

    - Engagement rings and fine jewelry
    - Watches
    - Art and collectibles
    - Antiques
    - Musical instruments
    - Camera equipment
    - Sports equipment (golf clubs, bikes)
    - Wine collections
    - Firearms
    - Furs

    Schedule any item whose value exceeds category sub-limit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Coverage advantages">
    Scheduled items receive broader protection:

    - Covered for full appraised value
    - All-risk coverage (not limited to named perils)
    - No deductible for scheduled items (typically)
    - Mysterious disappearance covered
    - Coverage worldwide

    Better protection than standard contents coverage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Appraisals">
    Insurers typically require appraisal for items over certain value (often \$5,000+).

    - Must be from qualified appraiser
    - Should be recent (within 2-3 years)
    - Update periodically as values change
    - Keep appraisal with policy documents

    Cost of appraisal is worthwhile for proper coverage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cost">
    Scheduled coverage costs vary by item type:

    **Typical rates (per \$100 of value annually):**

    - Jewelry: \$1 to \$2
    - Fine art: \$0.15 to \$0.50
    - Firearms: \$0.50 to \$1
    - Musical instruments: \$0.50 to \$1.50

    A \$10,000 ring might cost \$100 - \$200 annually to schedule.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>

    **Recommended:** For all homeowners. Construction costs can spike after widespread disasters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Guaranteed replacement cost">
