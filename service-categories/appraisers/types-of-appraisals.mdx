Different situations require different types of appraisals. The purpose of the appraisal affects who orders it, what standards apply, and how the report is used.

Understanding appraisal types helps property owners request the right service for their needs.

## Mortgage Appraisals

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Purchase appraisal">
    Required when buying a home with a mortgage. Lender orders through AMC or approved panel.

    **Purpose:** Confirm property value supports loan amount

    **Who pays:** Buyer (typically \$400 - \$600)

    **Timeline:** Usually completed within 1-2 weeks of order

    **Standard form:** URAR (Uniform Residential Appraisal Report) for most residential

    Appraiser knows the contract price, which provides context but shouldn't influence independent value conclusion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Refinance appraisal">
    Required when refinancing existing mortgage. Establishes current value for new loan terms.

    **Purpose:** Determine current value for loan-to-value calculation

    **Who pays:** Homeowner (typically \$400 - \$600)

    **Key differences from purchase:**

    - No contract price to consider
    - Appraiser relies solely on market data
    - Homeowner motivation is to maximize value

    Value determines available equity, rate options, and PMI requirements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Home equity appraisal">
    Required for home equity loans and HELOCs. May be full appraisal or alternative valuation.

    **Full appraisal:** Same as refinance appraisal

    **Desktop appraisal:** Appraiser uses data without interior inspection

    **AVM with validation:** Automated value with appraiser review

    Lender determines which method based on loan amount and risk factors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="FHA appraisal">
    For FHA-insured loans. Includes property condition requirements beyond value.

    **Additional requirements:**

    - Health and safety assessment
    - Minimum property standards
    - Required repairs before closing
    - FHA-specific forms

    **Common issues flagged:**

    - Peeling paint
    - Missing handrails
    - Broken windows
    - Roof damage
    - Safety hazards

    Appraiser must be FHA-approved. More detailed inspection than conventional.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="VA appraisal">
    For VA-guaranteed loans. Includes Minimum Property Requirements (MPRs).

    **Additional requirements:**

    - Safe, sanitary, and structurally sound
    - Adequate heating, electrical, and plumbing
    - Roof with reasonable remaining life
    - No wood-destroying insects

    Appraiser must be VA-approved. VA maintains list of approved appraisers by region.

    VA appraisals "stick" with property for 6 months, affecting subsequent VA buyers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="USDA appraisal">
    For USDA Rural Development loans. Property must meet location and condition requirements.

    **Requirements:**

    - Property in eligible rural area
    - Meets USDA property standards
    - Similar to FHA requirements

    Appraiser confirms eligibility and value.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Government loan appraisals (FHA, VA, USDA) assess both value and condition. Properties may appraise at full value but still fail to meet minimum property requirements, requiring repairs before loan approval.
</Note>

## Private Appraisals

Private appraisals are ordered directly by property owners or their representatives, not through lenders.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pre-listing appraisal">
    Ordered by seller before listing property for sale.

    **Purpose:** Determine market value to price accurately

    **Benefits:**

    - Price home correctly from start
    - Identify issues before buyers find them
    - Negotiate from informed position
    - Avoid overpricing and extended market time

    **Cost:** 400 to 600 (paid by seller)

    Not required but valuable for realistic pricing, especially in uncertain markets.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Estate appraisal">
    Required for settling estates and probate matters.

    **Purposes:**

    - Establish value for estate tax purposes
    - Divide assets fairly among heirs
    - Document value for court
    - Establish basis for beneficiaries

    **Date of value:** Typically date of death or alternate valuation date (6 months later)

    **Requirements:** May need to meet IRS standards for estate tax purposes. Often requires retrospective valuation if time has passed.

    **Cost:** \$400 - \$700 depending on complexity
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Divorce appraisal">
    Used to value marital property for equitable division.

    **Purposes:**

    - Establish value for asset division
    - Support buyout negotiations
    - Provide evidence for court

    **Options:**

    - Both parties agree on single appraiser
    - Each party hires own appraiser
    - Court appoints appraiser

    Single agreed-upon appraiser is most cost-effective if both parties will accept the result.

    **Cost:** \$400 - \$600 per appraisal
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Property tax appeal appraisal">
    Used to challenge property tax assessment.

    **Purpose:** Demonstrate market value is lower than assessed value

    **Requirements:**

    - Value as of assessment date (not current date)
    - Meet local appeal deadlines
    - Follow jurisdiction's appeal process

    **Cost-benefit:** Appraisal costs \$400 - \$600. Worth it if potential tax savings over multiple years exceed cost.

    Some appraisers specialize in tax appeal work.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Insurance appraisal">
    Establishes replacement cost for insurance coverage purposes.

    **Purpose:** Determine cost to rebuild, not market value

    **Key difference:** Insurance value is replacement cost, which may be higher or lower than market value.

    **When needed:**

    - High-value or unique homes
    - After major renovations
    - Homes in areas where land value dominates
    - Insurance company disputes

    Some appraisers specialize in replacement cost estimates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Relocation appraisal">
    For employee relocation programs where employer purchases home.

    **Process:** Often requires two independent appraisals that are averaged or reconciled.

    **Standards:** May follow Worldwide ERC guidelines for relocation appraisals.

    **Purpose:** Fair market value for employer home purchase programs.

<Warning>
  Using an appraisal for a purpose other than intended may not be appropriate. A mortgage appraisal has different standards than an estate appraisal. If you need valuation for a specific purpose, order an appraisal designed for that use.
