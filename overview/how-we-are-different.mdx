description: "Authentic reviews that can't be hidden, rankings based on performance not payment, and no spam from lead-selling platforms."
---

Most directories either sell your contact information, let businesses hide negative reviews, or prioritize advertisers over quality. We do none of that.

## Reviews You Can Actually Trust

### We Don't Host Reviews

All reviews come from Google Business Profiles. We pull them directly and display them as-is.

Other platforms host their own reviews, which means:
- Businesses can pressure the platform to remove negative feedback
- Reviews can be selectively displayed or hidden
- Suspicious activity is harder to catch
- You're never sure if you're seeing the full picture

Since we pull from Google, we can't hide reviews even if a business asks. Negative feedback shows up right alongside positive. What you see is what everyone sees.

### No Review Gating

Some platforms let businesses filter which customers get review requests. Happy customers get the email. Unhappy ones don't.

We pull all Google reviews. Businesses can't cherry-pick who leaves feedback.

## No Spam, No Lead Selling

### Your Contact Info Stays Private

Message professionals without sharing your phone number or email. Traditional contact forms require your info upfront, which triggers immediate sales calls and email sequences.

We let you ask questions, compare responses, and evaluate options before you share anything.

### We Don't Sell Leads

Some directories sell your contact information to multiple businesses. You fill out one form and get calls from five companies competing for your business.

We don't sell leads. When you message someone, only that professional sees your message. You control who gets your information and when.

## Rankings Based on Performance

### No Paid Placement

Search results rank by review ratings and volume. Businesses can't pay to appear first or boost their position.

Other directories prioritize advertisers, featured listings, or partnerships. You see who paid the most, not who performed the best.

### Compare Options Fairly

Every professional in a service category appears in search results if they match your location and filters. We don't limit results to "partners" or exclude businesses that don't advertise with us.

You see all qualified options, ranked by actual customer feedback.

## Built-In Education

### Learn What to Look For

Each service category includes guides explaining what the service does, how to evaluate professionals, what to ask during consultations, and what red flags to watch for.

Most directories just show profiles and reviews. We help you understand what you're looking at and what questions to ask.

### Compare Smarter

Guides explain typical pricing structures, common contract terms, and evaluation criteria for each service type. Use this information while comparing professionals to spot outliers or concerning patterns.

## Local Focus

We started in Maryland and are expanding based on professional density and review volume. This means comprehensive local coverage, not thin nationwide listings.

You see professionals who actually serve your area, not national companies with one person covering three states.
