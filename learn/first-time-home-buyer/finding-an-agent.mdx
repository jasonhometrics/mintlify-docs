title: "Finding an Agent"
description: "Choosing someone to represent your interests and guide your home search"
---

A buyer's agent represents your interests throughout the transaction. They help find properties, write offers, negotiate terms, and guide you through the contract process. Choosing the right agent matters because they influence every decision from first showing to closing day.

## What a Buyer's Agent Does

**Property search**

Agents access MLS listings, identify properties matching your criteria, schedule showings, and provide market context on pricing and competition.

**Offer strategy**

When you find the right property, your agent helps structure the offer including price, earnest money amount, contingencies, and timeline. They advise on how aggressive to be based on market conditions and competition.

**Negotiation**

Your agent negotiates on your behalf for purchase price, repairs after inspection, seller concessions, and contract terms. Their negotiation skill directly affects what you pay and what protections you retain.

**Transaction coordination**

Once under contract, your agent coordinates with the lender, title company, inspector, and other parties to keep the transaction moving toward closing.

**Vendor referrals**

Agents refer lenders, title companies, inspectors, and other service providers. These referrals may be based on past positive experiences, but you should verify any recommendation independently.

## How Agents Get Paid

Traditionally, sellers paid both the listing agent and buyer's agent through commission split. Recent changes mean buyers may now be responsible for negotiating and potentially paying their agent's compensation.

**What this means for you:**

- Discuss compensation upfront before signing a buyer agreement
- Understand whether seller is offering buyer agent compensation
- Know what you're agreeing to pay if seller doesn't cover it
- Compensation is negotiable

<Note>
  Commission structures are evolving. Ask direct questions about how your agent gets paid and what your financial obligation is before signing any agreement.

## When to Find an Agent

Research and interview agents before you start touring homes. Once you're actively looking, you'll want representation in place.

**Why timing matters:**

- Agents require signed buyer agreements before showing homes
- Good agents may not be available on short notice
- You need time to interview multiple candidates
- Starting without an agent means no representation if you find something quickly

## Questions to Ask Before Hiring

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Experience and track record">

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Availability and communication">
    - How quickly do you respond to calls and texts?
    - Are you available evenings and weekends for showings?
    - Will I work directly with you or a team member?
    - How do you keep clients informed throughout the process?
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Strategy and negotiation">
    - How do you approach offer strategy in competitive situations?
    - Can you share an example of a deal that went wrong and how you handled it?
    - How do you handle multiple offer situations?
    - What's your approach to inspection negotiations?
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Red Flags to Watch For

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pressure to act before you're ready">
    Good homes go fast, but if an agent pushes you to write offers before you've done due diligence or gotten proper pre-approval, that's a problem.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Vague about experience or volume">
    Agents who can't clearly answer questions about their transaction history may lack experience. Ask for specifics.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Poor communication from the start">
    How an agent communicates during the interview process reflects how they'll communicate during a transaction. Slow responses or vague answers are warning signs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Won't disclose vendor relationships">
    [RESPA](/service-categories/legal/consumer-protections/respa) requires disclosure of financial relationships with recommended vendors. If an agent avoids these questions, be cautious.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pushes preferred vendors without alternatives">
    Agents who insist you use their preferred lender or title company without explaining why or offering alternatives may have financial incentives you don't know about.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Talks more than listens">
    Your agent should understand your needs before making recommendations. If they dominate conversations without asking questions, they may not prioritize your interests.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Interview Multiple Agents

Don't hire the first agent you meet. Interview at least two or three before deciding.

**What to compare:**

- Experience with buyers in your situation
- Local market knowledge
- Communication style and responsiveness
- Availability that matches your schedule
- Transparency about compensation
- References from past clients
- Your comfort level with them

The agent you choose will guide you through a high-stakes, fast-moving process. Take time to find someone you trust.

## Buyer Agreements

Most agents require a signed buyer agreement before working with you. These agreements create obligations for both parties.

**What to understand before signing:**

- Duration of the agreement
- Geographic area covered
- Compensation terms
- Termination provisions
- Exclusivity requirements

Read the agreement carefully. Ask questions about anything unclear. Don't sign until you're comfortable with the terms.

<Warning>
Buyer agreements are contracts. Once signed, you may be obligated to pay your agent even if you find a home without their help. Understand the terms before committing.
</Warning>

## Verifying Referrals

Your agent will likely recommend a [lender](/service-categories/mortgage-lenders/comparing-lenders), [title company](/service-categories/title-escrow/comparing-title-companies), and other vendors. These recommendations may be excellent, but verify them yourself.

**For any referred vendor:**

- Check reviews from other customers
- Confirm credentials and licensing
- Ask about the agent's relationship with them
- Compare against alternatives you research independently

Referrals based on past positive experiences are valuable. Referrals based on financial arrangements may not serve your interests.
