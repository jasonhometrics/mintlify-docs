title: "Foreclosure Process"
description: "What happens when mortgage payments stop"
---

Foreclosure is the legal process lenders use to take back property when borrowers stop making payments. The lender sells the property to recover the unpaid loan balance.

Understanding the process helps homeowners explore options before losing their home.

## How Foreclosure Works

When mortgage payments stop, lenders don't immediately take the property. The process follows specific steps and timelines that vary by state.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missed payments">
    After one missed payment, lender contacts borrower. After 30 days, payment is reported late to credit bureaus.
    
    Most lenders don't begin foreclosure until payments are 90-120 days past due.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Notice of default">
    Formal notice that borrower is in default. This is the official start of foreclosure. Recorded with county in some states.
    
    Borrower typically has 30-90 days to catch up (reinstatement period).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Acceleration">
    Lender declares entire loan balance due immediately, not just missed payments. Catching up on back payments is no longer enough.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Foreclosure sale">
    Property sold at public auction. Highest bidder wins. If no bidders, lender takes ownership (REO property).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Eviction">
    If former owner hasn't vacated, lender obtains court order for removal. Sheriff enforces eviction.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Judicial vs Non-Judicial Foreclosure

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Judicial foreclosure">
    Lender files lawsuit and goes through court system. Judge oversees process and approves sale.
    
    **Timeline:** 6 months to 2+ years
    
    **States:** Required in about half of states, including Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Ohio
    
    **Borrower rights:** More time, court oversight, ability to contest
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Non-judicial foreclosure">
    Lender follows procedures in mortgage contract without court involvement. Faster process.
    
    **Timeline:** 2-6 months typically
    
    **States:** Allowed in states like California, Texas, Georgia, Arizona, Virginia
    
    **Borrower rights:** Fewer procedural protections, faster timeline
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Timeline Overview

| Stage | Typical Timeframe |
|-------|-------------------|
| First missed payment | Day 1 |
| Late payment reported | 30 days |
| Foreclosure process begins | 90-120 days |
| Notice of default | 90-120 days |
| Reinstatement period | 30-90 days after notice |
| Foreclosure sale | 4-12 months (judicial) or 2-4 months (non-judicial) |
| Eviction | 30-60 days after sale |

<Note>
Timelines vary significantly by state, lender, and whether borrower contests the foreclosure. Some states have mandatory waiting periods or mediation requirements that extend the process.
</Note>

## Options Before Foreclosure

<AccordionGroup>

    **Best for:** Long-term hardship with income to support modified payment
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Forbearance">

    **Best for:** Short-term hardship (job loss, medical issue) with expected recovery
  </Accordion>

    **Best for:** Small arrears with ability to pay more than regular payment going forward
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bankruptcy">
    Filing bankruptcy triggers automatic stay, temporarily stopping foreclosure. Chapter 13 may allow catching up over time.
    
    **Best for:** Need time to reorganize finances, have regular income
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sell the property">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Act early. Options decrease as foreclosure progresses. Once sale is scheduled, fewer alternatives exist. Contact lender at first sign of trouble.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Right to notice">

</AccordionGroup>

## Impact on Credit and Future

**Credit impact:**
- Foreclosure remains on credit report for 7 years
- Credit score typically drops 100-150+ points
- Difficulty obtaining new credit, including mortgages

**Future home buying:**
- FHA loans: 3-year waiting period (with exceptions)
- Conventional loans: 7-year waiting period (may be less with extenuating circumstances)
- VA loans: 2-year waiting period

**Deficiency judgments:**
If sale doesn't cover loan balance, lender may sue for the difference in some states. Other states prohibit deficiency judgments on primary residences.

## Scams to Avoid

<Warning>
Foreclosure rescue scams target desperate homeowners. Watch for:

- Guarantees to stop foreclosure
- Requests to sign over deed
- Upfront fees before services provided
- Pressure to stop communicating with lender
- Offers that seem too good to be true

Work with HUD-approved housing counselors (free) or licensed attorneys.
