description: "Negotiations, repair requests, and decision making"
---

Inspection findings inform post-inspection decisions. Buyers must evaluate results and decide whether to proceed, negotiate, or terminate the contract.

Understanding options helps buyers navigate this critical decision point effectively.

## Evaluating Findings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Categorize issues">
    Organize findings by type:

    **Safety hazards:** Must be addressed regardless of other factors

    **Major defects:** Significant repairs affecting value or habitability

    **Minor defects:** Small repairs or maintenance items

    **Maintenance items:** Normal homeowner responsibility

    Focus negotiations on safety and major defects.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Get repair estimates">
    For significant issues, obtain contractor quotes:

    - Contact appropriate tradespeople
    - Provide inspection report excerpt
    - Request written estimate
    - Ask about timeline and warranty

    Estimates strengthen negotiating position with concrete numbers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Research normal expectations">
    Consider what's typical:

    - Age of home
    - Price point
    - Market conditions
    - Seller disclosures
    - Comparable properties

    A 30-year-old roof in a home priced accordingly is normal, not a defect.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Assess cumulative impact">
    Individual issues may be minor, but consider total burden:

    - Sum of all needed repairs
    - Timeline of replacements
    - Ongoing maintenance required
    - Impact on budget and lifestyle
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Decision Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Proceed as-is">
    Accept property in current condition with no changes.

    **When appropriate:**

    - Issues are minor maintenance items
    - Price already reflects condition
    - Market conditions favor sellers
    - You're comfortable with findings

    Releases inspection contingency without negotiation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request repairs">
    Ask seller to complete specific repairs before closing.

    **Pros:**

    - Work done before you own property
    - Seller's contractor handles issues
    - Less out-of-pocket immediately

    **Cons:**

    - Quality depends on seller's choices
    - May delay closing
    - Limited control over contractors
    - May be done to minimum standard
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request credit">
    Ask for reduction in price or closing cost credit.

    **Pros:**

    - You control repairs and contractors
    - Choose materials and quality level
    - May exceed repair value in credit
    - No closing delay

    **Cons:**

    - Must pay for repairs yourself
    - Need cash available
    - Repairs are your responsibility
    - Financing may limit credit amount
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request price reduction">
    Reduce purchase price based on findings.

    **Pros:**

    - Lower purchase price
    - Reduced mortgage amount
    - Lower monthly payment

    **Cons:**

    - Appraisal must support new price
    - May not equal needed repair cost
    - Seller may resist perception of "lowball"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Terminate contract">
    Exercise inspection contingency to exit transaction.

    **When appropriate:**

    - Major defects exceed acceptable risk
    - Issues can't be reasonably resolved
    - Cost to repair changes property value proposition
    - Safety concerns too significant
    - Negotiations fail

    Earnest money typically returned if within contingency period.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Negotiation Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Focus on significant items">
    Limit requests to meaningful issues:

    - Safety hazards
    - Major defects
    - Items affecting habitability
    - Items affecting insurability

    Long lists of minor items can backfire. Sellers may refuse to negotiate at all.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Present factual requests">
    Frame requests professionally:

    **Strong approach:** "Inspection identified a failed water heater and absence of GFCI protection in bathrooms. We request either repairs or credit of \$2,500."

    **Weak approach:** "The house has too many problems. We need \$10,000 off."

    Tie requests to specific findings with cost support.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prioritize your needs">
    Decide what matters most:

    - Safety items (non-negotiable)
    - Big-ticket items (major value impact)
    - Items affecting financing or insurance
    - Nice-to-haves (can concede if needed)

    Knowing priorities helps reach agreement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider seller perspective">
    Understand seller's position:

    - Repair requests delay closing
    - Credits affect seller net proceeds
    - Seller may have already priced condition
    - Market conditions affect leverage

    Reasonable requests are more likely to succeed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use estimates as support">
    Contractor quotes strengthen requests:

    - Provides specific numbers
    - Demonstrates seriousness
    - Supports request reasonableness
    - Shows you've done due diligence

    "Three contractors estimate roof replacement at \$12,000 - 15,000" is stronger than "the roof needs work."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Negotiation is give and take. Approaching requests reasonably and professionally produces better results than adversarial demands. The goal is a fair resolution that allows the transaction to proceed.
</Note>

## What's Reasonable to Request

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Typically reasonable">
    - Safety hazards (electrical issues, missing railings)
    - Active leaks
    - Non-functioning major systems
    - Building code violations
    - Items affecting financing (FHA/VA requirements)
    - Items seller previously agreed to repair
    - Defects not disclosed that should have been
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Potentially reasonable">
    - Major system repairs (HVAC, roofing, plumbing)
    - Structural issues
    - Water intrusion remediation
    - Pest damage repair
    - Items discovered that change value proposition

    Depends on severity, price, and market conditions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Generally unreasonable">
    - Normal maintenance items
    - Cosmetic issues
    - Upgrades or improvements
    - Items visible before offer
    - Wear appropriate for home's age
    - Minor code items in older homes

    These are typically buyer responsibility.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Market affects expectations">
    **Seller's market:** Less leverage for buyers. Sellers may refuse most requests.

    **Buyer's market:** More leverage. Larger requests may be accepted.

    **Balanced market:** Reasonable requests for significant items typically accepted.

    Adjust expectations based on current conditions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Repair vs Credit

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When to request repairs">
    - Safety issues that should be fixed before occupancy
    - Items requiring permits (seller can pull permits more easily)
    - Repairs needed for financing approval
    - When you lack cash for repairs
    - Simple, straightforward repairs
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to request credit">
    - Complex repairs where quality matters
    - Items you want to upgrade anyway
    - When you have contractors you prefer
    - Repairs that could delay closing
    - When seller might do minimum quality work
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credit limitations">
    Lenders limit seller credits:

    - Conventional: 3-6% of price (varies by down payment)
    - FHA: 6% of price
    - VA: 4% of price

    Credits exceeding limits can't be applied. May need price reduction instead.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verifying repairs">
    If seller agrees to repairs:

    - Request documentation of work completed
    - Ask for receipts and warranties
    - Have items re-inspected before closing
    - Verify permits if required
    - Walk through before closing to confirm
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When to Walk Away

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Serious structural issues">
    Foundation problems, major settling, or structural damage can cost tens of thousands and may never fully resolve.

    Unless priced significantly below market, structural problems often warrant termination.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Environmental hazards">
    Significant mold, asbestos, lead, or other environmental issues can be expensive to remediate and may affect health.

    Consider carefully whether remediation is practical.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cumulative issues">
    Many moderate issues together may exceed reasonable investment.

    If total repair needs exceed 5-10% of price, evaluate whether property still makes sense.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Seller unwilling to negotiate">
    If seller refuses reasonable requests for significant items:

    - Consider whether you accept property as-is
    - Evaluate if price already reflects issues
    - Decide if issues are acceptable at current price
    - Be prepared to walk if not
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deal-breakers discovered">
    Some findings change everything:

    - Issues affecting insurability
    - Problems affecting financing
    - Conditions creating liability
    - Items you simply can't accept

    Inspection contingency exists for these situations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Walking away is sometimes the right decision. The inspection contingency protects buyers who discover unacceptable conditions. Don't let emotional attachment or sunk costs push you into a bad purchase.
</Warning>

## The Negotiation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review findings with agent">
    Discuss inspection report and identify items to address in negotiations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gather supporting information">
    Obtain repair estimates, specialist evaluations, or other documentation supporting your requests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare request">
    Create formal request listing items and desired resolution (repair, credit, or price reduction).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit to seller">
    Agent delivers request to seller's agent within contingency timeframe.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Seller responds">
    Seller may accept, reject, or counter-propose.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Negotiate if needed">
    Back-and-forth until agreement reached or negotiations fail.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document agreement">
    Signed amendment reflecting agreed resolution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify completion">
    If repairs agreed, verify completion before closing.
  </Step>
</Steps>
