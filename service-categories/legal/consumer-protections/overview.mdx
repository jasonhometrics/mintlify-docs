Federal laws protect consumers during real estate transactions. These regulations require disclosures, prohibit discriminatory practices, and ensure transparency in lending and settlement services.

Understanding these protections helps identify violations and know when rights are being compromised.

## Filing Complaints

When consumer protection violations occur, several agencies handle complaints:

**State Attorney General** Many states have additional consumer protection laws. State AG offices handle violations of state-specific regulations.

**State Real Estate Commission** Handles complaints against licensed real estate professionals.
