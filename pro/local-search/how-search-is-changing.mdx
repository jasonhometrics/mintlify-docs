description: "The shift from traditional search engines to AI-powered discovery and voice assistants"
---

Search technology is evolving from keyword matching to understanding intent and context. This shift affects how businesses appear in search results and how consumers discover local services.

The changes require businesses to think differently about their online presence. Information must be accurate, structured, and distributed across multiple platforms to remain visible.

## Traditional Search

Traditional search engines match keywords in a query to keywords on web pages and business listings. Results rank based on relevance signals like keyword density, backlinks, and domain authority.

For local searches, traditional engines added location-based filtering. A search for "title company Baltimore" returns listings that contain those keywords and are geographically relevant.

### How Traditional Search Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Query Processing">
    The search engine breaks the query into keywords and identifies modifiers like location terms.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Index Matching">
    Keywords are matched against an index of web pages, business listings, and other content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ranking">
    Results are sorted by relevance, authority, and location proximity. See [How Local Search Works](/pro/local-search/overview#how-local-search-works) for ranking factors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Display">
    The engine presents a list of links, often with a <Tooltip tip="The group of 3-4 local business results displayed with a map in search results">local map pack</Tooltip> for geographic queries.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Traditional search relies heavily on exact keyword matches. A business listing without specific service terms may not appear for related searches.

## AI-Powered Search

AI-powered search tools interpret meaning rather than matching keywords. These systems understand context, synonyms, and relationships between concepts.

<Tooltip tip="AI systems trained on large amounts of text that can understand and generate human language">Large language models</Tooltip> power tools like Google's AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot. These tools synthesize information from multiple sources to provide direct answers rather than lists of links.

### Key Differences from Traditional Search

| Aspect | Traditional Search | AI-Powered Search |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Query interpretation | Keyword matching | Intent understanding |
| Results format | List of links | Direct answers and summaries |
| Data sources | Indexed web pages | Multiple sources synthesized |
| User interaction | Click through to websites | Conversational follow-up |

### How AI Tools Find Business Information

AI systems pull data from structured sources:

- [Google Business Profiles](/pro/google-business-profile/overview)
- [Business directories and aggregators](/pro/business-listings/types-of-listings)
- Website content with schema markup
- Review platforms
- Social media profiles

These tools prioritize structured, consistent data. When information conflicts across sources, AI systems may exclude the business or provide inaccurate details.

<Warning>
AI-powered search tools may skip businesses entirely if their information is inconsistent or incomplete across sources. Unlike traditional search, there is no "page 2" of results to fall back on.
</Warning>

## Voice Search

Voice search uses spoken queries through devices like smartphones, smart speakers, and car systems. Voice assistants include Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, and Cortana.

Voice queries differ from typed searches in structure and length. Spoken searches tend to be conversational and question-based rather than keyword fragments.

### Voice Query Characteristics

### Voice Search Results

Voice assistants typically provide a single answer or a short list of options. There is no scrolling through multiple pages of results.

The assistant reads information directly from business listings. Accuracy of name, address, phone number, and hours becomes critical since the user cannot visually verify details. See [Maintaining Consistency](/pro/business-listings/maintaining-consistency) for guidance on keeping information accurate.

<Info>
Voice assistants pull data primarily from Google Business Profile for Android devices and Siri, and from Bing Places for Cortana. Maintaining accurate profiles on both platforms maximizes voice search visibility.

## Structured Data

<Tooltip tip="Information formatted in a standardized way that machines can easily read and interpret">Structured data</Tooltip> refers to information formatted in a standardized way that machines can easily read and interpret. This includes schema markup on websites and consistent formatting across business listings.

Search engines and AI tools use structured data to understand what a business does, where it operates, and how to contact it. Unstructured information requires interpretation, which introduces potential for errors.

### Types of Structured Data

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Schema Markup">
    Code added to websites that explicitly labels information. <Tooltip tip="A specific schema.org vocabulary for describing local businesses including name, address, hours, and services">LocalBusiness schema</Tooltip> identifies business name, address, hours, and services in a format search engines understand precisely.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Business Listing Fields">
    Standardized fields in platforms like [Google Business Profile](/pro/google-business-profile/overview). Categories, service areas, attributes, and hours follow defined formats rather than free text.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Aggregator Formats">
    [Aggregators](/pro/business-listings/types-of-listings) distribute business information to directories using standardized data formats. Consistent submission ensures accurate distribution.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Why Structured Data Matters

AI systems and voice assistants rely on structured data to provide accurate answers. When a user asks "What time does [business] close?", the answer comes from structured hours fields, not from parsing website text.

<Check>
Businesses with complete structured data across platforms are more likely to appear in AI-generated answers, voice search results, and rich search features like knowledge panels.
</Check>

Benefits of structured data include:

- Higher confidence in information accuracy
- Better matching to specific queries
- Eligibility for rich results and featured snippets
- Consistent information across AI platforms

<Tip>
Businesses can add schema markup to their websites using tools like Google's Structured Data Markup Helper or by working with a web developer. Google Search Console validates whether markup is correctly implemented.
</Tip>

## What This Means for Visibility

The evolution of search creates new requirements for local businesses:

| Change | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| AI synthesis | Information must be consistent across all sources |
| Voice answers | Single result means only top listings get mentioned |
| Intent matching | Services and specialties must be clearly documented |
| Structured data | Machine-readable formats increase accuracy and visibility |

Businesses that maintain accurate, structured information across multiple platforms position themselves for visibility in both traditional and emerging search channels.
