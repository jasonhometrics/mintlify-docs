## Why Professional Photography Matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Online search dominance">
    The vast majority of homebuyers begin their search online. Properties with professional photos receive significantly more views and engagement than those with amateur photography.
    
    First impressions are visual. Quality photos determine whether buyers click on a listing or scroll past.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Impact on showings">
    Professional photography generates more showing requests. Buyers are more likely to schedule in-person visits when they can clearly see and evaluate a property through quality images.
    
    Better photos lead to more qualified showings with genuinely interested buyers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sale price and speed">
    Research suggests homes with professional photography sell faster and often for higher prices than comparable homes with poor-quality photos. The National Association of Realtors reports that buyers consider photos the most useful feature of real estate websites.
    
    Professional presentation signals that the property and transaction are handled professionally.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Marketing across platforms">
    Professional photos are used across multiple marketing channels:
    
    - MLS listings
    - Real estate websites (Zillow, Realtor.com, etc.)
    - Agent and brokerage websites
    - Social media marketing
    - Email campaigns
    - Print materials and signage
    
    One professional photo shoot provides content for all marketing needs.
