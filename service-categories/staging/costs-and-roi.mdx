title: "Costs and Budgeting"
description: "What staging costs and whether it's worth the investment"
---

Staging costs vary significantly based on staging type, home size, market location, and rental duration. Understanding typical costs helps sellers budget appropriately and evaluate whether staging makes financial sense for their situation.

<Note>
  Staging costs vary significantly by location and provider. The figures below represent typical ranges based on industry data, but actual costs depend on your market, property, and specific provider. Always get quotes from multiple stagers.
</Note>

## Cost Factors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Staging type">
    The type of staging is the biggest cost driver:

    - **Vacant staging:** Most expensive (furniture rental required)
    - **Occupied staging:** Moderate (works with existing furniture)
    - **Partial staging:** Moderate (fewer rooms)
    - **Virtual staging:** Least expensive (digital only)
    - **Consultation only:** Least expensive (advice only)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Home size">
    Larger homes require more furniture and take longer to stage.

    - More rooms to furnish
    - More accessories needed
    - Longer installation time
    - Higher furniture rental costs
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Location">
    Staging costs vary by market. Higher cost-of-living areas typically have higher staging fees.

    Urban markets and luxury markets tend to cost more than suburban or rural areas.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rental duration">
    Longer rental periods increase total cost.

    Most staging companies have minimum rental periods (often 30 days). Extensions are typically available at additional cost.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Style and quality">
    Higher-end furniture and accessories cost more to rent. Luxury staging for high-end properties uses premium pieces with corresponding higher fees.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Typical Cost Ranges

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Consultation">
    **Typical range:** $150 to $600

    Covers initial property assessment, recommendations, and written report. Some stagers apply consultation fee toward full staging if hired.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Vacant home staging">
    **Typical initial cost:** $2,000 to $5,000+

    Includes furniture rental, delivery, installation, and first month rental. Larger homes and luxury properties cost more.

    **Monthly furniture rental:** Typically $500 to $600 per room per month after initial period.

    Total costs depend heavily on home size, rental duration, and market.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Occupied home staging">
    Fees vary significantly by location and provider.

    Occupied staging typically costs less than vacant staging because it works with existing furniture. Costs depend on how much supplemental furniture and accessories are needed.

    Get quotes from local stagers for your specific situation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Partial staging">
    Fees vary significantly by location and provider.

    Partial staging costs less than full staging because fewer rooms are involved. The specific cost depends on which rooms are staged and whether furniture rental is needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Virtual staging">
    **Typical range:** \$20 to \$75 per photo

    Total cost depends on number of photos staged. A typical listing might stage 5-10 photos, costing \$100 to \$750 total.

    Significantly less expensive than physical staging.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Who Pays for Staging

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Seller pays">
    Most commonly, the seller pays for staging as part of preparing the home for sale. Staging is a marketing expense, similar to professional photography.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent pays or subsidizes">
    Some listing agents cover staging costs as part of their marketing package. Others may subsidize a portion of staging expenses.

    This varies by agent and market. Discuss with your listing agent.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Split costs">
    Some arrangements split costs between seller and agent, or between seller and staging company (deferred until closing).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Seller concession">
    In some cases, staging costs can be negotiated as part of the listing agreement or recouped through seller proceeds at closing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Return on Investment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Research findings">
    Industry research suggests staging can provide positive ROI:

    - The Real Estate Staging Association reports staged homes may sell for 5% to 15% more than unstaged comparable homes
    - The National Association of Realtors reports 20% of buyers' agents said staging increased offers by 1% to 5%
    - Staged homes tend to sell faster, reducing carrying costs

    Results vary by market, price point, property condition, and staging quality.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Faster sales">
    Reduced time on market provides financial benefits:

    - Lower mortgage payments while listed
    - Lower utility and insurance costs
    - Reduced maintenance expenses
    - Earlier access to sale proceeds
    - Less stress and disruption

    Even modest reductions in days on market can offset staging costs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When ROI is strongest">
    Staging tends to provide best ROI for:

    - Vacant properties (empty rooms are hard to visualize)
    - Higher-priced homes (percentage gain is larger)
    - Competitive markets (need to stand out)
    - Properties that aren't selling (fresh approach)
    - Homes with good bones but dated presentation
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When ROI may be limited">
    Staging may provide less benefit for:

    - Very low-priced properties (cost is high relative to price)
    - Hot markets where anything sells quickly
    - Properties with significant condition issues
    - Homes already well-furnished and presented
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Calculating Potential ROI

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simple calculation">
    **Potential benefit:** Home price × potential price increase (1% to 5%)

    **Example:** \$400,000 home × 3% increase = \$12,000 potential benefit

    Compare potential benefit to staging cost to evaluate ROI.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider carrying costs">
    Calculate monthly costs of owning the home while listed:

    - Mortgage payment
    - Property taxes
    - Insurance
    - Utilities
    - HOA fees
    - Maintenance

    Faster sales reduce these costs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No guarantees">
    Staging doesn't guarantee higher prices or faster sales. Many factors affect sale outcomes:

    - Pricing accuracy
    - Market conditions
    - Property condition
    - Location
    - Marketing quality
    - Agent effectiveness

    Staging is one factor among many.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Budgeting for Staging

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rule of thumb">
    Some industry sources suggest budgeting approximately 1% of listing price for staging.

    - \$300,000 home: ~\$3,000 staging budget
    - \$500,000 home: ~\$5,000 staging budget
    - \$1,000,000 home: ~\$10,000 staging budget

    This is a rough guideline. Actual needs vary by property.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prioritizing budget">
    If budget is limited, prioritize:

    1. Living room (highest impact)
    2. Primary bedroom
    3. Kitchen (styling, not furniture)
    4. Dining room

    Virtual staging can supplement physical staging for secondary spaces.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Getting quotes">
    Get quotes from multiple stagers to understand local pricing. Provide:

    - Property address
    - Square footage
    - Number of rooms
    - Vacant or occupied status
    - Timeline
    - Budget parameters
  </Accordion>
