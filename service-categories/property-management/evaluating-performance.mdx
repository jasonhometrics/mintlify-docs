title: "Evaluating Performance"
description: "Metrics and indicators of quality management"
---

Property management performance can be measured through specific metrics and qualitative assessments. Regular evaluation helps owners determine if their manager is delivering adequate value and identify areas for improvement.

Performance should be assessed against both objective metrics and owner expectations.

## Key Performance Metrics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Vacancy rate">
    Percentage of time property is unoccupied.
    
    **Calculation:** (Vacant days / Total days) x 100
    
    **General benchmarks:**
    - Under 5%: Strong performance
    - 5% to 8%: Typical
    - Over 10%: May indicate issues
    
    Compare to local market averages. Some vacancy is normal during turnover.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Days to lease">
    Time from vacancy to new tenant move-in.
    
    Varies significantly by market conditions:
    - Hot markets: Faster
    - Average markets: Moderate
    - Slow markets: Longer
    
    Includes marketing, showing, application processing, and move-in. Ask your manager about typical timelines in your market.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rent collection rate">
    Percentage of rent collected on time.
    
    **Calculation:** (On-time payments / Total payments due) x 100
    
    **General benchmarks:**
    - 98%+ on-time: Strong
    - 95% to 98%: Typical
    - Under 95%: May indicate screening or enforcement issues
    
    Track both on-time and total collection rates.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tenant retention rate">
    Percentage of tenants who renew leases.
    
    **Calculation:** (Renewals / Lease expirations) x 100
    
    **General benchmarks:**
    - Over 70%: Strong retention
    - 50% to 70%: Typical
    - Under 50%: High turnover
    
    High retention reduces turnover costs. Some turnover is healthy for rent optimization.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Maintenance response time">
    Time from request to resolution.
    
    **General expectations:**
    - Emergency: Same day
    - Urgent: 24 to 48 hours
    - Routine: Within one week
    
    Track both initial response and completion times.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Eviction rate">
    Percentage of tenants evicted.
    
    **General benchmarks:**
    - Under 2%: Typical
    - Over 5%: May indicate screening issues
    
    High eviction rates may indicate poor screening. Some evictions reflect appropriate enforcement of standards.

    Rent should track market while balancing retention.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Maintenance spending">
    Repair and maintenance costs.
