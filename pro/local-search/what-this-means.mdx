The shift toward AI-powered and voice search creates specific requirements for local businesses. Visibility now depends on data quality, consistency, and proper structure across multiple platforms.

This page translates the [changes in search technology](/pro/local-search/how-search-is-changing) into actionable priorities for real estate service providers and other local businesses.

## Data Quality Matters More

AI systems and voice assistants need confidence in the information they present. These tools cross-reference multiple sources before including a business in results.

<Info>
  Unlike traditional search where a business might rank lower but still appear, AI-powered tools may exclude businesses entirely when data quality is insufficient.
</Info>

### What "Quality" Means

Data quality includes several factors:

| Factor       | Description                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accuracy     | Information matches reality (correct phone, current address, actual hours) |
| Completeness | All relevant fields are filled (services, categories, attributes)          |
| Freshness    | Information is regularly verified and updated                              |
| Richness     | Profile includes photos, descriptions, and detailed service information    |

A Google Business Profile with only name, address, and phone number provides less confidence than one with verified hours, service descriptions, photos, and active review responses.

### Quality Signals

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Positive Signals" icon="circle-check">
    - Complete profile information
    - Recent photos (last 90 days)
    - Owner-verified listing
    - Active review responses
    - Consistent NAP across web
  </Card>
  <Card title="Negative Signals" icon="circle-xmark">
    - Missing business hours
    - No service descriptions
    - Outdated or no photos
    - Unresponded reviews
    - Conflicting information online
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Consistency Becomes Critical

When the same business appears differently across platforms, AI systems cannot determine which version is correct. Inconsistencies create uncertainty that may result in exclusion from results.

<Warning>
  A business listed as "Smith Title Company" on Google, "Smith Title Co." on Yelp, and "Smith Title LLC" on its website creates three different identity signals. AI tools may treat these as separate entities or skip the business due to confusion.
</Warning>

### What Must Stay Consistent

<Tooltip tip="Name, Address, Phone - the core identifiers that must match exactly across all platforms">NAP consistency</Tooltip> forms the foundation of local search visibility. Beyond NAP, several other elements require alignment:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Business Name">
    Use the exact legal or DBA name everywhere. Avoid abbreviations on some platforms and full names on others. Do not add keywords or locations to the business name unless they are part of the legal name.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Address Format">
    Choose one format and use it everywhere. "Suite 100" vs "Ste 100" vs "#100" creates unnecessary variation. Include or exclude secondary address lines consistently.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Phone Number">
    Use the same primary number across all listings. Format consistently (with or without parentheses, dashes, or spaces). Tracking numbers can create inconsistency if not managed carefully.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Website URL">
    Link to the same URL everywhere. Decide whether to include "www" and use that format consistently. Ensure the URL resolves correctly without redirect chains.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Business Categories">
    Select equivalent categories across platforms. A title company should use "Title Company" on Google and the closest equivalent on other directories, not unrelated categories.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## AI Recommendations Require Structure

AI tools prefer structured data because it removes ambiguity. A business that clearly defines its services, service areas, and specialties in structured fields is easier for AI to understand and recommend.

### Structured vs. Unstructured

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Structured (Better)">
    **Google Business Profile Fields:**

    - Primary Category: Title Company
    - Services: Title Insurance, Settlement Services, Escrow Services
    - Service Area: Baltimore County, Howard County, Anne Arundel County
    - Attributes: Veteran-owned, By appointment only

    AI systems read these fields directly and match them to user queries with high confidence.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Unstructured (Harder to Parse)">
    **Website paragraph:** "We're a family-owned title company serving the greater Baltimore area. We handle all aspects of real estate closings including title searches, insurance, and settlements. Call us today!"

    AI must interpret this text, extract entities, and infer service areas. More room for error.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Where to Add Structure

<Steps>
  <Step title="Google Business Profile">
    Complete all available fields including services, products, attributes, and service areas. See [Optimizing Your Profile](/pro/google-business-profile/optimizing-your-profile) for details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Website Schema Markup">
    Add LocalBusiness schema to help search engines understand business details. Include organization type, address, hours, and service offerings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Directory Listings">
    Fill out all available fields on each platform rather than just the required minimum. Categories, specialties, and service descriptions improve matching.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Aggregators">
    Submit complete, structured information to aggregators that distribute to multiple directories. See [Types of Listings](/pro/business-listings/types-of-listings) for more on aggregators.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Action Priorities

Based on these changes, local businesses should focus on three areas:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="1. Audit Existing Presence" icon="magnifying-glass" href="/pro/business-listings/auditing-your-listings">
    Find all existing listings and identify inconsistencies that could confuse AI systems.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Optimize Google Business Profile" icon="google" href="/pro/google-business-profile/overview">
    Google remains the primary data source for most AI tools and voice assistants.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Establish Consistency" icon="arrows-rotate" href="/pro/business-listings/maintaining-consistency">
    Correct inconsistencies and create a system for maintaining accuracy over time.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
