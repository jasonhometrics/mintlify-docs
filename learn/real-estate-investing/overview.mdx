## Getting Started with Real Estate Investing

Real estate investing involves purchasing property to generate income, build equity, or both. Investors earn returns through rental income, property appreciation, and [tax advantages](/service-categories/accountants-tax/rental-property-taxes) not available with other investment types.

Real estate requires more capital, knowledge, and ongoing involvement than passive investments like stocks or bonds. Understanding the fundamentals helps investors evaluate whether real estate fits their financial goals and risk tolerance.

## Types of Real Estate Investments

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Residential rental properties">
    Single-family homes, condos, townhouses, and small multifamily properties (2-4 units) rented to tenants. Most accessible entry point for new investors.

    **Characteristics:**

    - Easier to finance with [conventional loans](/service-categories/mortgage-lenders/loan-types)
    - Smaller capital requirements than commercial
    - Tenants are individuals and families
    - Leases typically run 12 months
    - Investors can self-manage or hire [property managers](/service-categories/property-management/overview)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multifamily properties">
    Apartment buildings with five or more units. Classified as commercial real estate and require commercial financing.

    **Characteristics:**

    - Higher capital requirements and down payments
    - Economies of scale reduce per-unit costs
    - Vacancy in one unit has less impact on total income
    - Professional [property management](/service-categories/property-management/overview) typically required
    - Valued based on income rather than comparable sales
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Commercial properties">
    Office buildings, retail centers, industrial warehouses, and other non-residential properties leased to businesses.

    **Characteristics:**

    - Longer lease terms (3-10+ years common)
    - Tenants often responsible for maintenance, taxes, and insurance (triple net leases)
    - Higher barriers to entry
    - More complex due diligence
    - Economic cycles affect different property types differently
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="House hacking">
    Purchasing a property, living in part of it, and renting the rest. Common strategies include buying a duplex, renting spare bedrooms, or adding an accessory dwelling unit.

    **Characteristics:**

    - Owner-occupied financing available (lower down payments)
    - Rental income offsets housing costs
    - Hands-on landlord experience
    - Good entry point for new investors
    - Must be comfortable living near tenants
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fix and flip">
    Purchasing undervalued properties, renovating them, and selling for profit. Active investment strategy requiring renovation expertise and market knowledge.

    **Characteristics:**

    - Short holding periods (typically 3-12 months)
    - Profits taxed as ordinary income, not capital gains
    - Requires renovation knowledge or reliable contractors
    - Higher risk if market shifts or costs exceed estimates
    - No ongoing passive income
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Real estate investment trusts (REITs)">
    Publicly traded companies that own and operate real estate portfolios. Investors buy shares rather than physical property.

    **Characteristics:**

    - Completely passive investment
    - High liquidity (buy and sell like stocks)
    - Low minimum investment
    - No control over property decisions
    - Required to distribute 90% of taxable income as dividends
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Potential Benefits

Real estate offers several advantages compared to other investment types.

| Benefit             | Description                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cash flow**       | Rental income exceeding expenses provides monthly income            |
| **Appreciation**    | Property values generally increase over time                        |
| **Leverage**        | Mortgages allow controlling assets worth more than invested capital |
| **Tax advantages**  | [Depreciation](/service-categories/accountants-tax/rental-property-taxes), deductions, and [1031 exchanges](/service-categories/accountants-tax/1031-exchanges) reduce tax burden      |
| **Inflation hedge** | Rents and property values tend to rise with inflation               |
| **Tangible asset**  | Physical property with intrinsic value                              |

## Risks and Challenges

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Vacancy and tenant issues">
    Empty units generate no income while expenses continue. Problem tenants may pay late, damage property, or require eviction. Screening and reserves mitigate these risks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unexpected repairs">
    Major systems fail without warning. Roofs, HVAC, plumbing, and foundations can require significant capital. Maintenance reserves and [inspections](/service-categories/home-inspectors/overview) reduce surprise.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Market fluctuations">
    Property values decline during economic downturns. Investors who must sell during downturns may lose money. Long holding periods reduce market timing risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Illiquidity">
    Real estate cannot be sold quickly like stocks. Selling takes months and involves significant transaction costs. Investors need adequate reserves and should not invest funds they may need soon.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Management burden">
    Rental properties require ongoing attention. Even with [property managers](/service-categories/property-management/overview), owners make decisions and handle issues. Passive investors may prefer REITs or syndications.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Concentration risk">
    A single property represents concentrated risk. Diversification across multiple properties or markets reduces exposure to local economic changes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Financial Metrics

Investors use several metrics to evaluate potential investments.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cash-on-cash return">
    Annual cash flow divided by total cash invested. Measures the return on actual dollars invested, accounting for leverage.

    **Example:** \$6,000 annual cash flow ÷ \$50,000 invested = 12% cash-on-cash return
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cap rate (capitalization rate)">
    Net operating income divided by property price. Used to compare properties and estimate value. Does not account for financing.

    **Example:** \$24,000 NOI ÷ \$300,000 price = 8% cap rate
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Net operating income (NOI)">
    Gross rental income minus operating expenses (not including mortgage payments). Fundamental measure of property profitability.

    **Example:** \$36,000 rent - \$12,000 expenses = \$24,000 NOI
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Gross rent multiplier (GRM)">
    Property price divided by annual gross rent. Quick comparison tool, though less precise than cap rate or cash-on-cash return.

    **Example:** \$300,000 price ÷ \$36,000 annual rent = 8.3 GRM
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Debt service coverage ratio (DSCR)">
    NOI divided by annual mortgage payments. [Lenders](/service-categories/mortgage-lenders/overview) use this to evaluate loan risk. Higher ratios indicate more cushion to cover debt.

    **Example:** \$24,000 NOI ÷ \$18,000 annual debt service = 1.33 DSCR
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Before You Invest

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assess your financial position">
    Investment property requires capital for down payment (typically 20-25%), closing costs, reserves, and potential repairs. [Lenders](/service-categories/mortgage-lenders/overview) also consider your debt-to-income ratio and credit score.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define your goals">
    Different strategies serve different goals. Cash flow focuses on monthly income. Appreciation plays focus on long-term value growth. House hacking reduces living expenses. Clarify what you want to achieve.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Learn your target market">
    Real estate is local. Understand rents, vacancy rates, appreciation trends, and economic drivers in areas you are considering. What works in one market may not work in another.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build your team">
    Successful investors rely on professionals: [agents](/service-categories/real-estate-agents/overview) who understand investment property, [lenders](/service-categories/mortgage-lenders/overview) offering investor loans, [accountants](/service-categories/accountants-tax/overview) familiar with real estate tax strategy, and reliable contractors and [property managers](/service-categories/property-management/overview).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start with education">
    Learn before committing capital. Understand [financing options](/learn/real-estate-investing/financing-investment-property), how to analyze deals, [landlord-tenant law](/service-categories/legal/rentals/landlord-rights) basics, and [tax implications](/learn/real-estate-investing/tax-strategies). Mistakes in real estate are expensive.
