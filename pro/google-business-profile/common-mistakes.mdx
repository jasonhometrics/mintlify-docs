title: "Common Mistakes"
description: "Avoiding errors that reduce visibility or violate Google's guidelines"
---

Google Business Profile mistakes range from optimization errors that reduce visibility to guideline violations that risk suspension. Understanding common problems helps avoid them during setup and ongoing management.

Mistakes fall into three categories: incomplete profiles, inconsistent information, and policy violations.

## Incomplete Profiles

Leaving sections empty or partially filled reduces ranking potential and provides less information to potential customers.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing business hours">
    Listings without hours may not appear for "open now" searches. Customers cannot tell when to visit or call.
    
    **Fix**: Enter complete hours for all days. Add special hours for holidays.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No business description">
    The description helps Google understand the business and appears in search results.
    
    **Fix**: Write a clear 750-character description covering services, service area, and differentiators. See [Optimizing Your Profile](/pro/google-business-profile/optimizing-your-profile#business-description).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Missing or low-quality photos">
    Listings without photos receive fewer clicks. Poor-quality photos harm credibility.
    
    **Fix**: Upload at least 10 professional-quality photos covering exterior, interior, team, and work examples.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Only primary category selected">
    Secondary categories expand which searches the listing appears for.
    
    **Fix**: Add all relevant secondary categories. A title company might add "Escrow Service" and "Notary Public" if those services are offered.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Services section empty">
    The services section provides detailed information for both consumers and search algorithms.
    
    **Fix**: Add all services with descriptions. Organize into logical categories.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No attributes selected">
    Attributes help consumers filter businesses and add detail to the listing.
    
    **Fix**: Select all accurate attributes including ownership type, accessibility, and service options.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Check>
A complete profile ranks better and converts more views to actions. Profile completeness is one of the simplest optimization improvements to make.

## Inconsistent Information

Information that does not match across platforms or within the listing itself creates confusion.

### NAP Inconsistencies

| Problem | Example | Impact |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Name variations | "Smith Title" vs "Smith Title Company" | Search engines may see as different businesses |
| Address format differences | "Suite 200" vs "Ste 200" vs "#200" | Creates inconsistency signals |
| Multiple phone numbers | Different numbers on GBP vs website | Confuses consumers and algorithms |

<Warning>
NAP inconsistencies between GBP and the business website are particularly damaging. Google cross-references these sources, and mismatches reduce confidence in listing accuracy.
</Warning>

**Fix**: Establish a [consistency standard](/pro/business-listings/maintaining-consistency#creating-a-consistency-standard) and apply it to GBP and all other listings.

### Information Conflicts Within GBP

- Hours on GBP do not match hours on website
- Address shows differently in different sections
- Service area does not include actual service locations
- Categories do not match services listed

**Fix**: Audit the entire profile and ensure all sections align with each other and external sources.

## Ignoring Reviews

Failing to engage with reviews hurts both rankings and reputation.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Not Responding" icon="comment-slash">
    Unanswered reviews, especially negative ones, suggest disengagement or inability to resolve issues
  </Card>
  <Card title="Slow Responses" icon="clock">
    Delayed responses to negative reviews allow the narrative to stand unchallenged for longer
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Other review mistakes:

- **Arguing publicly**: Defensive responses make the business look bad regardless of who is right
- **Generic responses**: Copy-paste responses to all reviews appear insincere
- **Not encouraging reviews**: Waiting for organic reviews results in slower accumulation
- **Incentivizing reviews**: Offering rewards for reviews violates Google's policies

**Fix**: Set up notifications for new reviews. Respond to all reviews within 48 hours. See [Managing Reviews](/pro/google-business-profile/managing-reviews) for response guidelines.

## Guideline Violations

Policy violations can result in listing suspension. Some violations are obvious; others are common practices that actually violate guidelines.

### Keyword Stuffing in Business Name

<Warning>
Adding keywords, locations, or marketing phrases to the business name violates Google's guidelines. The name should match the real-world business name exactly.
</Warning>

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Smith Title Company - Best Title Insurance Baltimore | Smith Title Company |
| Smith Title Company ★★★★★ | Smith Title Company |
| Smith Title Company (Se Habla Español) | Smith Title Company |

Consequences: Listing suspension, removal of name changes, or reduced rankings.

### Fake or Misleading Information

- Creating listings for locations that do not exist
- Using virtual office addresses without physical presence
- Setting service areas beyond actual operating range
- Selecting categories for services not actually offered

### Manipulating Reviews

- Buying fake reviews
- Offering incentives for positive reviews
- Selectively asking only happy customers for reviews
- Posting reviews from employees without disclosure
- Using review exchange services

### Duplicate Listings

- Creating multiple listings for the same location
- Creating separate listings for each service instead of using services section
- Maintaining listings for closed locations

<Info>
Google may not catch violations immediately, but penalties can apply retroactively. Businesses have had years of review history removed after policy violations were discovered.
</Info>

## Neglecting the Listing

GBP requires ongoing attention, not just initial setup.

### Signs of Neglect

- Last photo uploaded years ago
- Holiday hours never updated
- No posts in months
- Unanswered questions in Q&A section
- Suggested edits accepted by Google without review

### Consequences of Neglect

- Profile staleness signals to algorithms
- User-suggested edits may change information incorrectly
- Competitors' listings appear more active and trustworthy
- Missed opportunities to engage with potential customers

**Fix**: Schedule regular GBP maintenance. Weekly quick checks, monthly deeper reviews. See [Maintaining Consistency](/pro/business-listings/maintaining-consistency#maintenance-schedule).

## Fixing Mistakes

Most mistakes can be corrected:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Audit the profile">
    Review every section of the GBP listing for errors and omissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prioritize fixes">
    Address guideline violations first, then NAP consistency, then completeness.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make corrections">
    Update information through the GBP dashboard. Changes may take hours to days to reflect.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor results">
    Watch for suggested edits that revert changes. Confirm fixes remain in place.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Establish maintenance routine">
    Prevent future issues with regular monitoring.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If a listing has been suspended due to guideline violations, Google provides a reinstatement process. Review the suspension notice, correct the violations, and submit a reinstatement request.
</Tip>
