## Why Tax Planning Matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Buying">
    Establish correct cost basis from day one. Understand which closing costs are deductible vs added to basis. Identify available credits for first-time buyers or energy improvements.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Selling">
    Primary residence exclusion can eliminate up to 500,000 in capital gains (married filing jointly). Timing, residency requirements, and proper documentation affect eligibility.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Renting out property">
    Landlords can deduct expenses, depreciate the structure, and potentially qualify for pass-through deduction. Depreciation recapture affects eventual sale.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Investing">
    1031 exchanges defer capital gains indefinitely. Cost segregation accelerates depreciation. Entity structure affects tax treatment.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When to Involve a Tax Professional

**Before buying:**
- Understanding tax benefits of ownership
- Evaluating rent vs buy from tax perspective
- Planning for investment property purchases

**Before selling:**
- Calculating potential capital gains
- Timing sale for optimal tax outcome
- Evaluating 1031 exchange options

**Ongoing ownership:**
- Annual tax preparation with real estate holdings
- Rental property record keeping
- Property tax assessment reviews

**Complex situations:**
- Multiple properties
- Mixed personal and rental use
- Business use of home
- Inherited property
- Divorce-related transfers

<Note>
Tax law changes frequently. Strategies that worked in previous years may not apply currently. Professional guidance ensures compliance with current rules.
</Note>

## Tax Planning vs Tax Preparation

**Tax planning:** Proactive strategies to minimize taxes before transactions occur. Done throughout the year, especially before major decisions.

**Tax preparation:** Filing returns after the tax year ends. Reports what already happened.

Both matter. Planning creates opportunities. Preparation ensures accuracy and compliance.
