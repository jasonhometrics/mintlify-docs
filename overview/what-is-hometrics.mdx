---

Hometrics brings all real estate service providers into one searchable directory. Compare professionals based on verified reviews, filter by your specific needs, and connect directly without sharing contact information.

## How It Works

Hometrics aggregates verified customer reviews from Google Business Profiles and organizes professionals into service categories covering every aspect of real estate transactions.

### Review Aggregation

All reviews displayed on Hometrics come from Google Business Profiles. Reviews are not collected, modified, or filtered by the platform. What you see reflects actual customer experiences.

### Performance Badges

Hometrics assigns [performance badges](/overview/performance-badges) to businesses that demonstrate consistent service quality through verified customer reviews and engagement patterns. Badges help you quickly identify high-performing providers.

### Search and Filtering

Search by service type, location, and specific criteria relevant to each category. Filter results by rating thresholds, review volume, services offered, credentials held, and business characteristics.

Advanced filters include:

- Languages spoken 
- Weekend and evening availability
- [Special discounts](/overview/special-offers-discounts)
- Response time
- Wire fraud protection and secure payment options
- [View all differentiators](/overview/differentiators)

### Learn and Engage

Hometrics is a space where you can learn about real estate services and engage with professionals. Educational content explains what each service category does and what to look for when hiring. Once you understand what matters, connect directly with providers who meet your needs.

### Direct Communication

Contact businesses directly through phone, email, or the platform messaging system. Your contact information remains private until you choose to share it.
