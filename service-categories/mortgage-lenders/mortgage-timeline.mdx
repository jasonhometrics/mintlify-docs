# What to Expect

**You've chosen your lender. Now what?**

The mortgage process has distinct phases, each with its own timeline and requirements. Understanding what happens when prevents surprises and keeps your transaction moving forward.

**Total timeline:** 30-45 days from contract to closing (plus 1-3 days for pre-approval upfront).

## Phase 1: Pre-Approval (Before You Shop)

**Timeline:** 1-3 business days

This happens before you tour homes. Your lender verifies your finances and determines how much they're willing to loan you.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Gather your documents">
    **W2 employees:**

    - Last 2 years of W2s
    - Last 30 days of pay stubs
    - Last 2 months of bank statements

    **Self-employed:**

    - Last 2 years of personal tax returns
    - Business tax returns (if applicable)
    - Year-to-date profit & loss statement
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lender reviews and verifies">
    They pull your credit, calculate debt-to-income ratio, and verify your income is stable and sufficient for the loan amount.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pre-approval letter issued">
    You receive a letter stating the maximum loan amount you're approved for. This letter goes with every offer you write.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What can go wrong:** Income doesn't verify the way you expected (bonus income requires 2 consecutive years, commission income gets averaged, self-employed income after deductions is lower than anticipated).

**How to prevent it:** Be honest and thorough during your initial conversation. If you have non-traditional income, flag it immediately.

## Phase 2: Under Contract (Days 1-3)

**Timeline:** Within 3 business days of offer acceptance

Your offer was accepted. Now the clock starts ticking.

**What happens:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="You Submit Earnest Money" icon="money-check-dollar">
    Wire or deliver your deposit (typically 1-3% of purchase price) to the title company within 3 business days per contract terms.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lender Orders Appraisal" icon="house-circle-check">
    You pay the appraisal fee (typically \$400-600). The lender orders an independent appraisal to verify the property's value supports the loan amount.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Critical:** Verify wire instructions via phone using a number you look up independently. Never trust emailed wiring instructions without verbal confirmation. Wire fraud is real.

## Phase 3: Loan Processing (Days 4-20)

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

Your loan moves from application to processing. This is where most of the paperwork happens.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Application Submitted">
    You complete the formal loan application (different from pre-approval). This includes property address, final loan amount, and any updated financial information.

    **Your lender will ask for:** Updated pay stubs, verification of any large deposits in your bank accounts, confirmation that your employment hasn't changed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Processing Begins">
    The loan processor reviews all documentation, orders verification of employment, and ensures everything is ready for underwriting.

    **Common requests:**

    - Letters of explanation for credit inquiries
    - Documentation for any large deposits (gifts, bonuses, transfers)
    - Additional bank statements if initial ones are outdated
    - Proof of homeowners insurance
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Appraisal Completed">
    The appraiser inspects the property and delivers their report (typically 7-10 days after order).

    **Three possible outcomes:**

    - Appraisal matches or exceeds purchase price (deal moves forward)
    - Appraisal comes in low (you may need to renegotiate, bring more cash, or walk away)
    - Appraisal flags issues (foundation problems, unpermitted work, etc.)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Title Work in Progress">
    While processing happens, the title company researches the property's ownership history to ensure there are no liens, claims, or legal issues that would prevent transfer.

    **Common issues:** Unpaid property taxes, contractor liens, boundary disputes, missing signatures on previous transfers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  **Don't make any major financial changes during this phase:**

  - No new credit cards or loans
  - No large purchases (cars, furniture, etc.)
  - No job changes
  - No moving money between accounts without explanation

  Any of these can delay or kill your loan approval.
</Warning>

## Phase 4: Underwriting (Days 21-35)

**Timeline:** 5-10 business days

Your loan goes to underwriting—the final review before approval. An underwriter examines every detail to ensure you meet program guidelines and can repay the loan.

**What underwriters verify:**

- Income is stable and sufficient
- Credit meets program requirements
- Property appraises for loan amount
- Debt-to-income ratio is acceptable
- All documentation is complete and accurate

<Tip>
  **Underwriters ask questions in "conditions."** These are requests for additional documentation or clarification. Getting conditions is normal—even strong loans get them. Respond quickly to keep your timeline on track.
</Tip>

**Common conditions:**

- Letter explaining a gap in employment
- Updated pay stub showing current income
- Verification that earnest money cleared your account
- Proof of homeowners insurance payment
- Explanation of recent credit inquiry

**Best case:** You receive "Clear to Close" in 5-7 days.\
**Worst case:** Missing documentation or unresolved credit issues delay approval by weeks.

## Phase 5: Clear to Close (Days 36-40)

**Timeline:** 3-5 days before closing

"Clear to Close" means underwriting has approved your loan. Final steps remain before you can close.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Closing Disclosure delivered">
    You receive your Closing Disclosure at least 3 business days before closing. This document shows your final loan terms, monthly payment, and closing costs.

    **Review it carefully.** Compare it to your Loan Estimate. If numbers changed significantly, ask why.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Final walkthrough scheduled">
    Typically 24-48 hours before closing. You verify the property is in the agreed-upon condition and any negotiated repairs were completed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wire funds confirmed">
    Your lender wires the loan amount to the title company. You wire your down payment and closing costs (minus earnest money already deposited).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **The 3-day rule:** Federal law requires lenders to provide your Closing Disclosure at least 3 business days before closing. If significant terms change, the clock resets. This protects you but can delay closing if problems surface late.
</Note>

## Phase 6: Closing Day

**Timeline:** 1-2 hours

You meet at the title company (or attorney's office, depending on your state) to sign final documents and complete the purchase.

**What to bring:**

- Government-issued photo ID
- Proof of homeowners insurance
- Cashier's check or wire confirmation for closing costs
- Final walkthrough notes (if issues were found)

**What you'll sign:**

- Promissory note (your promise to repay the loan)
- Deed of trust or mortgage (gives lender claim to property if you default)
- Closing Disclosure (confirms you reviewed final costs)
- Title transfer documents
- Various disclosures and state-specific forms

**The signing takes 1-2 hours.** A licensed settlement agent walks you through each document. Don't rush. Ask questions about anything you don't understand.

**After signing:** The title company records the deed with the county. Once recorded (same day or next day), you officially own the property. Keys are typically released after recording is confirmed.

## Common Delays and How to Avoid Them

## What "Clear to Close" Actually Means

You'll hear this term and assume you're done. You're not.

**Clear to Close means:**

- Underwriting has approved your loan
- All conditions have been satisfied
- The lender is ready to fund

**Clear to Close does NOT mean:**

- You can stop responding to lender requests
- You can make credit changes
- Your job is secure until after closing
- You're guaranteed to close on the scheduled date

**Lenders can (and do) re-verify employment and credit right before funding.** Any changes can delay or cancel your loan even after Clear to Close.

## Your Role Throughout the Process

**What your lender expects from you:**

✓ **Respond quickly** - When they ask for documents, provide them within 24 hours\
✓ **Stay employed** - Don't change jobs during the process\
✓ **Freeze your credit** - No new credit cards, loans, or major purchases\
✓ **Communicate changes** - Tell your lender immediately if anything changes financially\
✓ **Stay organized** - Keep all documents in one place for easy access\
✓ **Read everything** - Don't sign documents you don't understand

<Warning>
  **Lenders re-verify employment right before closing.** Getting fired, quitting, or switching jobs between Clear to Close and closing day can kill your loan. Wait until after you have keys in hand.
</Warning>

## The Bottom Line

The mortgage process is predictable when you know what's coming. Documents flow. Milestones pass. Closing happens.

**What makes it smooth:**

- Experienced lender who communicates proactively
- You respond quickly to requests
- No financial surprises
- Property appraises and title clears

**What makes it a nightmare:**

- Lender discovers problems late because pre-approval was weak
- You make credit changes mid-process
- Documentation is incomplete or slow to arrive
- Employment or income changes unexpectedly

**Stay on top of it. Respond fast. Don't make financial changes. You'll be fine.**
