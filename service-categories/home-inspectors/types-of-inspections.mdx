title: "Types of Inspections"
description: "General, radon, mold, sewer, termite, and specialty inspections"
---

Different inspection types assess different aspects of a property. A general home inspection covers major systems and components, while specialty inspections examine specific concerns in greater detail.

Understanding available inspection types helps buyers determine which services their situation requires.

## General Home Inspection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What it covers">
    Comprehensive examination of visible, accessible components:

    - Structural elements
    - Exterior surfaces and features
    - Roof and attic
    - Plumbing systems
    - Electrical systems
    - Heating and cooling
    - Interior spaces
    - Insulation and ventilation
    - Built-in appliances
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Standards followed">
    Most inspectors follow established standards:

    - **ASHI:** American Society of Home Inspectors Standards of Practice
    - **InterNACHI:** International Association of Certified Home Inspectors Standards
    - **State standards:** Some states have specific requirements

    Standards define minimum inspection scope and reporting requirements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Duration and cost">
    - **Time:** 2 to 4 hours depending on home size
    - **Cost:** \$350 - \$600 for typical single-family home
    - **Report:** Delivered same day to 48-hours
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to get one">
    Recommended for virtually all home purchases. Standard practice in residential transactions.

    Even new construction and recently renovated homes can have defects.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Radon Testing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What radon is">
    Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that seeps from soil into buildings. It's colorless and odorless, detectable only through testing.

    Long-term radon exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How testing works">
    **Short-term test:** Device placed in lowest livable level for 48 to 96 hours. Measures average radon concentration.

    **Long-term test:** Device remains for 90+ days. More accurate representation of annual exposure.

    Most real estate transactions use short-term tests due to time constraints.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Understanding results">
    Results measured in picocuries per liter (pCi/L).

    - **Below 2 pCi/L:** Low risk
    - **2 to 4 pCi/L:** Consider mitigation
    - **4 pCi/L and above:** EPA recommends mitigation

    No level is completely safe. EPA action level is 4 pCi/L.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cost and timing">
    - **Cost:** \$125 - \$200 (often bundled with general inspection)
    - **Duration:** 48 to 96 hours for short-term test
    - **Results:** Same day test is retrieved
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mitigation">
    If levels are elevated, radon mitigation systems can reduce concentrations.

    - **Cost:** \$800 - \$2,500 for typical installation
    - **Effectiveness:** Usually reduces levels by 80-99%
    - **Method:** Sub-slab depressurization most common

    Mitigation is usually seller's responsibility or negotiated credit.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Radon levels vary by geography, but elevated readings can occur anywhere. EPA recommends testing all homes regardless of location, especially those with basements or slab foundations.
</Note>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who performs it">
    Usually performed by licensed pest control companies, not general home inspectors.

    **Licensing:** Most states require pest control license for WDI inspections.

    Some home inspectors hold both licenses and can perform combined inspections.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Report types">
    **NPMA-33 form:** Standard form used in many states for real estate transactions.
