title: "Reviewing Offers"
description: "Evaluating buyer offers and negotiating terms"
---

When offers arrive, the listing agent presents each one with analysis of price, terms, contingencies, and buyer qualification. Sellers evaluate the complete picture, not just the offer price.

## Offer Components

Every offer includes several elements that affect the seller's net proceeds and transaction risk.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Purchase price">
    The total amount the buyer offers to pay. Higher price doesn't always mean better offer if other terms create risk or cost.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Earnest money">
    Deposit demonstrating buyer's serious intent, typically 1-3% of purchase price. Larger deposits indicate stronger commitment and create more buyer risk if they default.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Down payment and financing">
    How the buyer plans to pay. Cash offers eliminate financing risk. Larger down payments reduce lender denial risk. Pre-approval letter strength matters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Closing date">
    When the transaction will complete. Sellers may prefer faster closings or need time to relocate. Flexibility on timing can be valuable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Contingencies">
    Conditions that must be met for the contract to proceed. Fewer contingencies or shorter contingency periods reduce seller risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Included/excluded items">
    What personal property the buyer wants included (appliances, fixtures, furniture). May affect net value of the offer.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Contingencies from the Seller's Perspective

Contingencies protect buyers but create risk and uncertainty for sellers. Understanding each contingency helps evaluate offer strength.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Financing contingency">
    Allows buyer to terminate if loan is denied. Protects buyer's earnest money. Risk to seller: deal falls through late in the process if financing fails. Stronger pre-approval reduces this risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inspection contingency">
    Allows buyer to terminate or renegotiate based on inspection findings. Risk to seller: buyer may request repairs, credits, or price reductions after inspections. Shorter inspection periods reduce time at risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Appraisal contingency">
    Allows buyer to terminate if property appraises below purchase price. Risk to seller: may need to reduce price or lose the deal if appraisal is low. Appraisal gap coverage reduces this risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Home sale contingency">
    Makes purchase contingent on buyer selling their current home. Risk to seller: transaction depends on a separate sale the seller doesn't control. Kick-out clauses provide some protection.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Multiple Offer Situations

When multiple offers arrive, sellers have several options.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Accept the best offer">
    Choose the strongest offer based on price, terms, and buyer qualification. Transaction proceeds with that buyer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Counter one offer">
    Select one offer to negotiate with, rejecting others. Common when one offer is close but needs adjustment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Counter multiple offers">
    Send counteroffers to multiple buyers simultaneously. Creates competition but risks losing all buyers if they feel manipulated.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request highest and best">
    Ask all buyers to submit their strongest offer by a deadline. Useful when multiple offers are similar or when expecting more interest.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Evaluating Offer Strength

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Buyer qualification">
    - Pre-approval letter from reputable lender
    - Verification level (full documentation vs quick approval)
    - Down payment amount and source
    - Proof of funds for cash offers
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Terms that strengthen offers">
    - Larger earnest money deposit
    - Fewer or shorter contingencies
    - Appraisal gap coverage
    - Flexible closing date
    - As-is acceptance
    - Waived contingencies (with appropriate risk acknowledgment)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Terms that weaken offers">
    - Minimal earnest money
    - Extended contingency periods
    - Home sale contingency
    - Excessive seller concessions
    - Unusual requests or conditions
    - Weak or unverified financing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Counteroffers and Negotiation

Sellers can accept, reject, or counter any offer. Counteroffers create new offers that buyers can accept, reject, or counter in return.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What sellers typically counter">
    - Purchase price
    - Closing date
    - Contingency periods
    - Earnest money amount
    - Included/excluded items
    - Repair requests or credits
    - Seller concessions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Counteroffer strategy">
    - Counter on terms that matter most
    - Consider the full package, not just price
    - Respond promptly to maintain momentum
    - Be willing to compromise on less important terms
    - Know your bottom line before negotiating
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to accept vs counter">
    Accept when the offer meets your goals or market conditions suggest it's the best you'll receive. Counter when terms need adjustment but the buyer seems motivated and qualified.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Seller Responses to Repair Requests

After inspections, buyers typically request repairs or credits. Sellers have options.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agree to all repairs">
    Transaction proceeds as modified. Seller completes repairs before closing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agree to some repairs">
    Negotiate specific items. Common approach focuses on safety issues and major systems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Offer credit instead">
    Provide closing cost credit or price reduction instead of making repairs. Buyer handles repairs after closing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Refuse all requests">
    Decline to make repairs or offer credit. Buyer decides whether to proceed or terminate.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Cosmetic issues and minor maintenance items are typically not negotiated. Focus negotiations on safety issues, major system problems, and items that affect habitability or financing.
</Note>
