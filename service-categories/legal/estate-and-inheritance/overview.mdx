## How Property Transfers at Death

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Joint Ownership with Survivorship">
    Property automatically passes to surviving owner(s) without probate. Common between spouses. Requires only death certificate and affidavit to update title.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transfer-on-Death Deed">
    Property passes to named beneficiary without probate. Available in about half of states. Owner retains full control during lifetime.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Living Trust">
    Property held in trust passes according to trust terms without probate. Trustee manages transfer. Requires property to be titled in trust name during owner's lifetime.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will">
    Property passes according to will terms through probate process. Court supervises transfer. Takes longer and costs more than non-probate methods.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Intestate (No Will)">
    Property passes according to state law through probate. Spouse and children typically inherit. State determines distribution if no close relatives.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Concepts

| Term                                 | Meaning                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Probate**                          | Court process validating will and supervising estate distribution |
| **Executor/Personal Representative** | Person responsible for administering estate                       |
| **Beneficiary**                      | Person receiving property from estate or trust                    |
| **Intestate**                        | Dying without a valid will                                        |
| **Trust**                            | Legal arrangement where trustee holds property for beneficiaries  |
| **Life Estate**                      | Right to use property during lifetime, then passes to another     |

## Common Situations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Parent Dies, Children Inherit">
    If property was solely owned, goes through probate. If held in trust or with transfer-on-death deed, avoids probate. Multiple children may inherit as co-owners.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Spouse Dies">
    Jointly-owned property typically passes automatically to surviving spouse. Solely-owned property may require probate depending on state and estate size.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Owner Becomes Incapacitated">
    Power of attorney allows designated person to manage property. Without POA, court-supervised guardianship may be required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Selling Inherited Property">
    May require probate completion, all heir signatures, or trustee authority depending on how property was inherited. Title companies verify authority before closing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When to Get Legal Help

**Estate planning:** Creating wills, trusts, or transfer-on-death deeds. Structuring ownership for tax efficiency or probate avoidance.

**After death:** Probate filing, resolving disputes among heirs, clearing title issues, handling creditor claims.

**Property management:** Power of attorney documents, guardianship proceedings, trust administration.

<Note>
  Estate and inheritance laws vary significantly by state. Strategies that work well in one state may not be available or advisable in another. Consult local attorneys for state-specific guidance.
