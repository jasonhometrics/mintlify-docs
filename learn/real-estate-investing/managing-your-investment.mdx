## Operating Your Rental Property

Property management encompasses everything required to maintain the property, keep it occupied, and collect rent. Investors choose between handling these tasks themselves or hiring professional management.

The right approach depends on the investor's time, proximity to the property, number of units, and willingness to handle landlord responsibilities directly.

## Cost of Property Management

Professional management fees reduce cash flow but provide time savings and expertise.

| Fee Type              | Typical Range                 | Notes                                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Monthly management    | 8-12% of collected rent       | Core ongoing fee                       |
| Leasing fee           | 50-100% of first month's rent | Charged when placing new tenant        |
| Lease renewal fee     | \$100-300 or percentage       | Some managers charge, others include   |
| Maintenance markup    | 10-20%                        | Added to vendor invoices               |
| Eviction coordination | \$200-500+                    | Plus legal costs                       |
| Vacancy fee           | Varies                        | Some charge reduced fee during vacancy |

<Note>
  Fee structures vary significantly. Compare total costs across managers, not just the headline management percentage.
</Note>

## Evaluating Property Managers

Not all property managers deliver the same service quality. Evaluate carefully before hiring.

**Questions to ask:**

- How many units do you manage?
- What is your vacancy rate across your portfolio?
- How do you handle maintenance requests?
- What is your tenant screening process?
- How do you handle evictions?
- What reports will I receive and how often?
- What is your fee structure including all fees?
- Can I speak with current clients as references?
- What is your communication style and response time?

<Warning>
**Red flags when evaluating property managers:**
- Unwilling to provide references
- Unclear or complicated fee structure
- High portfolio vacancy rates
- Poor online reviews from tenants or owners
- Slow response during your evaluation process
- No written management agreement
</Warning>

## Tenant Screening

Selecting reliable tenants is the most important factor in successful property management. Consistent, thorough screening reduces late payments, evictions, and property damage.

### Screening Criteria

Establish written criteria applied consistently to all applicants to ensure fair housing compliance.

| Criterion        | Common Standard             | Purpose                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Income           | 2.5-3x monthly rent         | Ability to pay            |
| Credit score     | 620-680 minimum             | Payment history indicator |
| Rental history   | 2+ years positive history   | Past landlord behavior    |
| Background check | No recent evictions         | Risk indicator            |
| Employment       | Verified current employment | Income stability          |

<Warning>
  Apply screening criteria consistently to all applicants. Inconsistent application creates fair housing liability.
</Warning>

### Screening Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-screening">
    Before showing the property, verify basic qualifications: income range, move-in timeline, reason for moving, pets, number of occupants. This saves time showing to unqualified applicants.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Application">
    Collect a written application with authorization to verify information and run credit and background checks. Charge an application fee to cover costs (where permitted by law).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Credit check">
    Review credit report for payment history, outstanding collections, and overall score. Look for patterns rather than isolated issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Background check">
    Check for eviction history and criminal background. Follow fair housing guidelines regarding how criminal history is considered.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Income verification">
    Verify income through pay stubs, tax returns, or employer contact. Self-employed applicants may require additional documentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rental history verification">
    Contact previous landlords to verify payment history, lease compliance, and whether they would rent to the applicant again.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decision">
    Approve, deny, or approve with conditions (such as additional deposit where permitted). Provide adverse action notice if denying based on credit report.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Screening Services

Several services provide tenant screening for landlords:

- TransUnion SmartMove
- RentPrep
- Experian Connect
- MyRental
- Avail (for smaller landlords)

Costs typically range from \$25-50 per applicant, often paid by the applicant as part of the application fee.

## Rent Collection

    Offer convenient payment options:

    - Online payment portals (most efficient)

    - Check or money order
    - Payment apps (Venmo, Zelle)

    Avoid cash payments when possible due to documentation and safety concerns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Due dates and grace periods">
    Most leases specify rent due on the 1st with a grace period (often 3-5 days) before late fees apply. Be consistent in applying the lease terms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Late fees">
    Charge late fees as specified in the lease. State laws may limit late fee amounts. Consistent enforcement encourages on-time payment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Non-payment response">
    When rent is not paid:

    1. Contact tenant to understand situation
    2. Serve pay or quit notice per state law

    4. Begin eviction process if not resolved

    Document all communications and actions.
