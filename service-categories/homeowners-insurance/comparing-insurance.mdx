title: "Comparing Insurance"
description: "Questions to ask and evaluating providers"
---

Homeowners insurance premiums and coverage vary significantly between providers. Shopping effectively requires comparing more than just price. Claims handling, financial strength, and coverage terms matter as much as premium cost.

A systematic approach to comparison helps homeowners find the right balance of coverage, service, and value.

## What to Compare

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Coverage terms">
    Policies with similar premiums may have different coverage:

    - Policy form (HO-2, HO-3, HO-5)
    - Dwelling coverage amount
    - Personal property limits and sub-limits
    - Liability limits
    - Deductible options
    - Replacement cost vs actual cash value
    - Extended replacement cost percentage
    - Loss of use coverage
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Premium cost">
    Get quotes for identical coverage to compare accurately.

    **Request quotes with:**

    - Same dwelling coverage amount
    - Same deductible
    - Same liability limit
    - Same personal property coverage
    - Replacement cost on contents

    Price differences of 20-40% between insurers for identical coverage are common.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deductible options">
    Different deductibles affect both premium and out-of-pocket costs.

    **Get quotes at multiple deductible levels:**

    - \$500
    - \$1,000
    - \$2,500
    - \$5,000 (if available)

    Compare premium savings against increased risk per claim.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Available discounts">
    Discounts vary by insurer. Ask about:

    - Multi-policy (bundle home and auto)
    - Security systems
    - New home
    - Claims-free
    - Loyalty
    - Payment method
    - Professional associations
    - Senior/retiree

    One insurer's best discount may not match another's base rate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Endorsement availability">
    Not all insurers offer all endorsements:

    - Water backup coverage
    - Equipment breakdown
    - Service line coverage
    - Scheduled personal property
    - Identity theft
    - Home business

    If you need specific coverage, verify availability before committing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Evaluating Insurers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Financial strength">
    Insurer must be able to pay claims, especially after widespread disasters.

    **Check ratings from:**

    - AM Best (A or better recommended)
    - Standard & Poor's (A or better)
    - Moody's (A3 or better)

    Ratings are available on insurer websites or rating agency sites.

    Avoid insurers with ratings below A or with negative outlook.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Claims satisfaction">
    How insurer handles claims matters most when you need them.

    **Research sources:**

    - J.D. Power Home Insurance Study
    - Consumer Reports ratings
    - State insurance department complaints
    - Online reviews (Google, Yelp)
    - NAIC complaint index

    Look for patterns in complaints. Occasional negative reviews are normal. Consistent claims problems are red flags.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="NAIC complaint ratio">
    National Association of Insurance Commissioners tracks complaints relative to market share.

    **Complaint index:**

    - 1.0 = average complaints for market share
    - Below 1.0 = fewer complaints than expected
    - Above 1.0 = more complaints than expected

    Available at naic.org or your state insurance department.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="State insurance department">
    State regulators track insurer performance:

    - Complaint history
    - Regulatory actions
    - Financial examinations
    - Market conduct issues

    Search your state insurance department website for insurer information.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Local presence">
    Consider whether insurer has local agents and adjusters:

    **Benefits of local presence:**

    - Easier communication
    - Faster claims response
    - Agent knows local risks
    - In-person service available

    National insurers may use independent adjusters who are less familiar with your area.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  The cheapest policy isn't always the best value. An insurer that denies claims or delays payments costs more in the long run than slightly higher premiums from a reliable company.
</Note>

## Questions to Ask

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Coverage questions">
    - What policy form is this (HO-2, HO-3, HO-5)?

    - Will you notify me before non-renewal?
    - How are premium increases communicated?
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Red Flags

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Significantly lower premium">
    If one quote is dramatically lower than others, investigate why:

    - Different policy form (HO-2 vs HO-3)
    - Lower coverage limits
    - Higher deductible
    - Actual cash value instead of replacement cost
    - Missing endorsements
    - Exclusions other policies don't have

    Apples-to-apples comparison reveals true value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Poor financial ratings">
    Insurers with weak ratings may not pay claims:

    - Rating below A from AM Best
    - Recent downgrade
    - Negative outlook
    - State regulatory concerns

    Financial strength matters most after major disasters when many claims are filed simultaneously.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="High complaint ratios">
    Consistent pattern of complaints indicates problems:

    - NAIC complaint ratio above 1.5
    - Multiple years of high complaints
    - Complaints specifically about claims handling
    - Regulatory actions for claims practices

    Check both national data and state-specific complaints.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pressure tactics">
    Quality insurers don't need high-pressure sales:

    - Pressure to decide immediately
    - Reluctance to provide written quotes
    - Unwillingness to explain coverage details
    - Discouraging comparison shopping
    - Vague answers to specific questions

    Take time to compare. Don't be rushed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unusually restrictive terms">
    Some insurers have stricter terms than industry standard:

    - Shorter time to report claims
    - More exclusions
    - Lower sub-limits
    - Stricter maintenance requirements
    - More reasons to deny claims

    Read policy documents carefully before committing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Beware of quotes that seem too good to be true. Significantly lower premiums often mean less coverage, higher deductibles, or an insurer with claims payment issues.
</Warning>

## How to Shop

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Get multiple quotes">
    Obtain at least 3-5 quotes to understand the market:

    - 2-3 national insurers
    - 1-2 regional insurers
    - Independent agent representing multiple companies

    More quotes provide better comparison data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use consistent information">
    Provide identical information to each insurer:

    - Same dwelling coverage amount
    - Same deductible
    - Same liability limit
    - Accurate property information
    - Complete disclosure of claims history

    Inconsistent information makes comparison impossible.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request full policy documents">
    Review actual policy terms, not just quote summaries:

    - Policy declarations page
    - Coverage forms
    - Endorsements
    - Exclusions list

    Quote summaries may omit important details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Compare annual cost">
    Look at total annual premium, not just monthly payment:

    - Monthly payments may include fees
    - Pay-in-full discounts affect true cost
    - Some quotes may be for different terms

    Annual premium is the accurate comparison point.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    - Available discounts
    - Agent/service quality

    - Can you afford the deductible?

    - Choose insurer with best combination of factors
    - Don't second-guess based on minor premium differences
