Selling a home can trigger capital gains taxes on the profit. However, significant exclusions exist for primary residences that allow many sellers to pay little or no tax. Understanding the rules before closing helps with financial planning.

## Capital Gains Exclusion

The primary residence exclusion is the most valuable tax benefit for homeowners selling their home.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Exclusion amounts">
    - Single filers: Up to \$250,000 excluded
    - Married filing jointly: Up to \$500,000 excluded

    Gains within these limits are completely tax-free. No tax owed, no reporting required in most cases.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ownership and use tests">
    To qualify for full exclusion, must meet both tests during the 5-year period ending on sale date:

    - **Ownership test:** Owned the home for at least 2 years (730 days)
    - **Use test:** Lived in the home as primary residence for at least 2 years (730 days)

    The 2 years don't need to be continuous. Total of 24 months within the 5-year period qualifies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Married couples">
    To claim full \$500,000 exclusion:

    - File joint return
    - At least one spouse meets ownership test
    - Both spouses meet use test
    - Neither spouse used exclusion in prior 2 years
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Frequency limitation">
    Can only use exclusion once every 2 years. If you sold another home and claimed exclusion within the past 2 years, you cannot claim again.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When You Owe Taxes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Gain exceeds exclusion">
    If your gain exceeds \$250,000 (single) or \$500,000 (married), the excess is taxable. Long-term capital gains rates (0%, 15%, or 20%) apply if you owned the property more than one year.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Don't meet ownership/use tests">
    If you owned or lived in the home less than 2 years, a partial exclusion may be available if the sale was due to job relocation, health reasons, or unforeseen circumstances.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Used exclusion recently">
    If you claimed the exclusion on another home sale within the past 2 years, you cannot claim it again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rental or business use">
    If part of the home was used for rental or business, gain must be allocated. The exclusion applies only to the residential portion. Depreciation recapture may also apply.
  </Accordion>

## Calculating Net Proceeds

Net proceeds are what you actually receive after all costs are deducted from the sale price.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What reduces proceeds">
    - Real estate agent commission
    - Title insurance and settlement fees
    - Transfer taxes
    - Recording fees
    - Prorated property taxes
    - HOA payoffs and prorations
    - Mortgage payoff
    - Repairs agreed to in contract
    - Home warranty (if seller pays)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sample calculation">
    - Sale price: \$450,000
    - Minus commission (5%): \$22,500
    - Minus closing costs: \$8,000
    - Minus mortgage payoff: \$280,000
    - **Net proceeds: \$139,500**

    Your listing agent and title company can provide estimated net proceeds before closing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Costs that reduce taxable gain">
    Selling costs reduce your taxable gain (not just your proceeds):

    - Agent commissions
    - Legal fees
    - Title insurance
    - Transfer taxes
    - Staging costs
    - Repairs required by contract
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Timing Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Meeting the 2-year requirement">
    If you're close to meeting ownership or use tests, waiting to sell can save significant taxes.

    Example: Owned 22 months, planning to sell. Waiting 2 more months qualifies for $250,000 exclusion. At 15% capital gains rate, waiting could save $37,500.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Year-end timing">
    Gain is taxed in the year the sale closes. If your income varies year to year, timing the closing can affect your tax rate.

    - Higher income year: Consider delaying closing to January
    - Lower income year: Consider closing before December 31
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Moving Timeline and Coordination

Coordinate your move with your closing date to ensure a smooth transition.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="8 weeks before closing">
    - Research moving companies
    - Get at least 3 estimates
    - Create inventory of belongings
    - Start decluttering and decide what to keep, sell, or donate
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="4-6 weeks before closing">
    - Book moving company
    - Confirm estimate in writing
    - Begin packing non-essentials
    - Notify important contacts of address change
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2 weeks before closing">

    - Continue packing
    - Arrange mail forwarding
    - Transfer or establish utilities at new address
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="1 week before closing">

## Choosing a Moving Company

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Get multiple estimates">
    Get at least 3 estimates. In-home or video surveys are more accurate than phone estimates. Understand whether estimates are binding (guaranteed price) or non-binding (can increase).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verify licensing">
    For interstate moves, verify the company has valid USDOT and MC numbers through the FMCSA database. Local movers should have state licensing where required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check reviews and complaints">
    Read reviews focusing on damage claims, pricing accuracy, and communication. Check FMCSA complaint history for interstate movers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Understand valuation coverage">
    Basic coverage (60 cents per pound) provides minimal protection. Full value protection costs more but covers actual replacement value. Review options before moving day.
  </Accordion>
