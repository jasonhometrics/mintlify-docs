title: "Environmental Disclosures"
description: "Hazards, flood zones, and required disclosures"
---

Environmental issues affect property value, insurability, and health. Federal and state laws require disclosure of known hazards. Some issues require remediation before sale; others must simply be disclosed.

Understanding environmental concerns helps buyers evaluate risks and sellers meet legal obligations.

## Federal Disclosure Requirements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Lead-based paint">
    Required for homes built before 1978. Sellers and landlords must:

    - Disclose known lead paint and hazards
    - Provide EPA pamphlet "Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home"
    - Include specific disclosure language in contracts
    - Allow 10-day inspection period for buyers (can be waived)

    Applies to sales and rentals. Violations can result in fines over \$10,000 per occurrence.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Flood zone disclosure">
    Lenders must notify borrowers if property is in Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). Flood insurance required for federally-backed mortgages in these zones.

    Some states require seller disclosure of flood zone status regardless of financing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Environmental Hazards

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Asbestos">
    Common in homes built before 1980. Found in insulation, floor tiles, roofing, siding, and pipe wrap.

    Not dangerous if undisturbed. Hazardous when fibers become airborne during renovation or deterioration. Professional testing recommended before remodeling older homes.

    **Disclosure:** Required in most states if known. No federal mandate for residential sales.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Radon">
    Naturally occurring radioactive gas. Enters homes through foundation cracks. Second leading cause of lung cancer.

    Present in all 50 states. Levels vary by geography and home construction. Testing is inexpensive (under \$50 for DIY kits).

    **Disclosure:** Required in many states if tested and elevated. Mitigation systems typically cost \$800 - \$2,500.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mold">
    Grows in damp conditions. Health effects range from allergies to serious respiratory issues. Indicates moisture problem that needs correction.

    **Disclosure:** Required in many states if known. Some states require specific mold disclosure forms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Underground storage tanks">
    Common for heating oil in older homes. Tanks leak over time, contaminating soil and groundwater. Cleanup costs can be substantial (\$10,000 - \$100,000+).

    **Disclosure:** Required in most states. Tank removal or certification often required for sale.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Well and septic">
    Properties not connected to municipal water/sewer have private systems requiring maintenance and eventual replacement.

    **Disclosure:** Required in most states. Many require inspection and certification before sale.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Chinese drywall">
    Defective drywall imported 2001-2009. Emits sulfur gases causing health issues and corrosion of metal components. Mostly found in Southeast US.

    **Disclosure:** Required if known. Remediation involves complete drywall replacement.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Flood Zones

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="FEMA flood maps">
    Federal Emergency Management Agency maps flood risk areas. Maps show:

    - **Zone A, AE, AH, AO:** High risk (100-year flood zone). Flood insurance required with federal mortgage.
    - **Zone X (shaded):** Moderate risk (500-year flood zone). Insurance recommended but not required.
    - **Zone X (unshaded):** Minimal risk. Insurance optional.

    Check maps at msc.fema.gov/portal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Flood insurance">
    Standard homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage. Separate flood policy required.

    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) provides coverage in participating communities. Private flood insurance also available.

    Cost varies by zone and coverage. Policies have 30-day waiting period before coverage begins.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Flood history">
    Some states require disclosure of past flooding or flood insurance claims. Federal law requires disclosure if property has had multiple flood claims.

    Ask sellers directly about flooding history. Check with neighbors and local officials.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Map changes">
    FEMA updates flood maps periodically. Property not currently in flood zone may be remapped. Previously flooded areas may also be remapped out.

    Zone changes affect insurance requirements and costs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Flood maps don't guarantee safety. Properties outside mapped flood zones still flood. Climate change is increasing flood frequency in many areas. Consider flood insurance even if not required.
</Warning>

## Other Natural Hazards

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Earthquake zones">
    Some states (California, Oregon, Washington) require disclosure of seismic hazard zones. Special construction requirements may apply.

    Earthquake insurance is separate from homeowners insurance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wildfire risk">
    High-risk areas may have insurance limitations, vegetation management requirements, and special building codes.

    Some states require wildfire risk disclosure. Check state fire marshal or forestry department for risk maps.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Coastal erosion">
    Shoreline properties face erosion risk. Setback requirements may limit building. Some states require disclosure of erosion rates.

    Affects insurability and long-term property value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sinkholes">
    Common in areas with limestone bedrock (Florida, Texas, parts of Midwest). Can cause catastrophic property damage.

    Some states require disclosure of known sinkhole activity. Specialized insurance may be needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Contamination Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Nearby contamination">
    Properties near gas stations, dry cleaners, industrial sites, or landfills may be affected by migrating contamination.

    Check EPA databases for Superfund sites and brownfields. State environmental agencies track known contamination.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Soil contamination">
    Previous uses (agriculture, industry, gas stations) may have left contaminated soil. Testing recommended if history is uncertain.

    Cleanup responsibility falls on property owner. Can be extremely expensive.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Groundwater contamination">
    Affects well water quality. May originate on property or migrate from nearby sources.

    Testing recommended for all well-water properties. Required in many states before sale.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Due Diligence for Buyers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review disclosures carefully">
    Read all seller disclosures thoroughly. Ask follow-up questions about anything unclear. Vague answers warrant investigation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Order inspections">
    General inspection may not cover all environmental issues. Consider specialized inspections for:

    - Radon testing
    - Lead paint assessment
    - Asbestos survey
    - Mold inspection
    - Septic and well testing
    - Underground tank detection
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Research property history">
    - Check historical aerial photos for previous uses
    - Search environmental databases
    - Review prior permits and violations
    - Ask neighbors about property history
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check flood and hazard zones">
    - Review FEMA flood maps
    - Check state hazard disclosures
    - Research insurance availability and cost
    - Ask about past claims or damage
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Environmental issues don't always prevent purchase but affect value and future costs. Knowing issues upfront allows informed decisions and price negotiations.
</Note>

## Seller Obligations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Disclose what you know">
    Most states require disclosure of known environmental issues. "Known" means actual knowledge, not speculation.

    When in doubt, disclose. Failure to disclose known issues creates liability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Federal requirements">
    Lead paint disclosure required for pre-1978 homes. No exceptions.

    Penalties for non-compliance include fines and potential liability for buyer's damages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="State requirements">
    Vary significantly. May require specific disclosure forms for:

    - Radon
    - Mold
    - Flood zone
    - Natural hazards
    - Underground tanks
    - Well and septic

    Check state requirements or consult real estate attorney.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Remediation Considerations

If environmental issues are discovered:

**Before purchase:** Negotiate seller remediation, price reduction, or credit. Walk away if costs are uncertain or excessive.

**After purchase:** Obtain professional assessment. Get multiple remediation quotes. Check for available grants or programs (lead paint, underground tanks).

**Liability:** Current owner generally responsible for cleanup regardless of who caused contamination. Factor this into purchase decisions.
