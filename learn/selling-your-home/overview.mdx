description: "The home selling journey from preparation to closing"
---

Selling a home involves preparing the property, marketing it to buyers, negotiating offers, and completing a closing transaction. Most sales take 60 to 90 days from listing to closing, though timelines vary based on market conditions and property characteristics.

This learning path covers each phase of the selling process and the professionals involved.

## Timeline at a Glance

| Phase          | Typical Timing | Key Activities                                 |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-listing    | 2-4 weeks      | Agent selection, repairs, staging, photography |
| Active listing | 1-8 weeks      | Showings, open houses, offer collection        |
| Under contract | 30-45 days     | Buyer inspections, appraisal, title work       |
| Closing        | 1-2 hours      | Document signing, fund transfer, key handoff   |

Market conditions significantly affect the active listing phase. Properties in high-demand markets may receive offers within days. Properties in slower markets or with unique characteristics may take longer.

## Order of Operations

The sequence matters. Hiring professionals in the wrong order creates delays and limits options.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Interview listing agents">
    Before doing anything else, select your listing agent. They'll guide pricing, timing, and which improvements are worth making. Compare at least three agents before signing a listing agreement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete repairs and improvements">
    Your agent will recommend which repairs affect sale price and which don't matter. Focus on issues that appear in most inspection reports: roof, HVAC, water intrusion, electrical, and plumbing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stage and photograph">
    Professional staging and photography happen after repairs are complete. These marketing materials determine how many buyers see your listing and request showings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set price and go live">
    Your agent will provide a comparative market analysis. Pricing strategy affects how long the property sits and what offers you receive.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review offers and negotiate">
    Evaluate offers based on price, terms, contingencies, and buyer qualification. Your agent negotiates on your behalf.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate the contract period">
    Once under contract, the buyer conducts inspections and the lender orders an appraisal. Respond to repair requests and resolve any title issues that arise.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Close and transfer ownership">
    Sign closing documents, receive proceeds, and hand over keys. Your net proceeds arrive via wire transfer or check after all costs are deducted.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Mistakes Sellers Make

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Overpricing based on emotional attachment">
    What you paid, what you've invested, and what the home means to you don't determine market value. Overpriced homes sit longer and often sell for less than properly priced homes because buyers assume something is wrong.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Skipping pre-listing preparation">
    Buyers notice deferred maintenance. Issues discovered during buyer inspections become negotiation points that reduce your net proceeds. Addressing problems before listing keeps you in control.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Choosing an agent based on highest price estimate">
    Some agents quote high prices to win listings, then pressure you to reduce later. Evaluate agents on marketing plan, experience, and track record rather than who promises the highest sale price.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ignoring disclosure obligations">
    Sellers must disclose known material defects. Failure to disclose can result in legal liability after closing. When in doubt, disclose.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Being unavailable for showings">
    Every showing is a potential buyer. Restricting access or requiring excessive notice reduces the pool of interested buyers and extends time on market.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Taking negotiations personally">
    Buyer requests for repairs or price reductions are normal parts of the process. Emotional reactions can derail deals that would have closed with calm negotiation.
