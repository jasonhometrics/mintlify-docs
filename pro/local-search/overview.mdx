Local search refers to the process of finding businesses, services, or information tied to a specific geographic area. It includes searches performed on search engines, maps applications, directories, and voice assistants.

For service-based professionals, local search determines whether potential clients can find them when actively looking for help. Visibility in local search results directly affects lead generation and business growth.

## How Local Search Works

Search engines use three primary factors to determine which businesses appear in local results:

  <Card title="Relevance" icon="bullseye">
    How well a business listing matches what someone is searching for
  </Card>
  <Card title="Distance" icon="location-dot">
    How close the business is to the searcher or the location specified in the query
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prominence" icon="star">
    How well-known and trusted a business appears based on online signals
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Relevance

Relevance measures the match between a search query and a business listing. Search engines analyze business names, categories, descriptions, and services to determine fit.

A title company listing "title insurance" and "settlement services" in its profile will appear for those specific searches. A listing with only a business name and address provides less information for matching.

### Distance

Distance calculations use the searcher's location or a location included in the query. Searches like "title company near me" use device location. Searches like "title company in Bethesda" use the named location.

For service-area businesses that travel to clients, search engines use the registered business address or defined service areas. Accurate address information ensures proper distance calculations.

### Prominence

Prominence reflects how established and reputable a business appears online. Search engines measure prominence through several signals:

- Review quantity and quality
- Consistency of business information across the web
- Website authority and content
- Mentions in news, directories, and other websites
- Engagement with business listings

Businesses with more reviews, consistent information, and broader online presence typically rank higher than those with minimal digital footprints.

## Where Local Searches Happen

Consumers search for local businesses across multiple platforms:

  <Accordion title="Search Engines">
    Google, Bing, and other search engines display local results for queries with local intent. These results often appear in a "Map Pack" or "Local Pack" showing 3-4 businesses with maps, reviews, and contact information.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Maps Applications">
    Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze serve as primary search tools for many consumers. Users search directly within these apps rather than starting with a traditional search engine.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Directories and Review Sites">
    Yelp, Better Business Bureau, and industry-specific directories attract consumers researching service providers. These platforms often rank highly in search engine results as well.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Voice Assistants">
    Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant respond to voice queries like "find a mortgage lender near me." These assistants pull from the same data sources as their parent platforms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Social Platforms">
    Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn include local business search features. Consumers may discover businesses through social recommendations or direct searches within these platforms.

## Local Intent

Local intent describes searches where the user wants results tied to a specific location. Search engines identify local intent through explicit and implicit signals.

### Explicit Local Intent

The query includes location information:

- "Real estate attorney Baltimore"
- "Title company in Montgomery County"
- "Mortgage lender 21201"

### Implicit Local Intent

The query implies local need without stating location:

- "Settlement company near me"
- "Home inspector open now"
- "Best property manager"

Search engines interpret certain service categories as inherently local. Searches for real estate services, legal help, or financial services typically trigger local results even without location keywords.

## The Local Search Ecosystem

Local search results depend on data from multiple sources:

| Data Source       | Role                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Business listings | Primary source of name, address, phone, hours, and services  |
| Review platforms  | Provide ratings, review counts, and consumer feedback        |
| Websites          | Offer detailed service information and credibility signals   |
| Data aggregators  | Distribute business information to directories and platforms |
| Social profiles   | Supply additional business details and engagement signals    |

Search engines and AI tools cross-reference these sources to verify accuracy. Consistent information across sources increases confidence in the data. Inconsistencies create uncertainty and may reduce visibility.
