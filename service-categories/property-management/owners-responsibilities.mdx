title: "Owners Responsibilities"
description: "What owners still handle when using a property manager"
---

Hiring a property manager doesn't eliminate all owner involvement. Owners retain certain responsibilities and decision-making authority even with full-service management.

Understanding the division of responsibilities helps set appropriate expectations and maintain a productive relationship.

## Financial Responsibilities

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Funding reserves">
    Owners must maintain adequate funds for:

    - Operating reserves (manager holds for routine expenses)
    - Capital reserves (major repairs and replacements)
    - Emergency funds

    Managers cannot advance funds indefinitely. Underfunded accounts delay repairs and create problems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Major expense approval">
    Owners typically approve expenses above a threshold:

    - Capital improvements
    - Non-emergency large repairs
    - Appliance replacements
    - Vendor contract commitments

    Fast owner response prevents delays and tenant frustration. Establish clear approval limits in your management agreement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mortgage and taxes">
    Managers typically don't pay:

    - Mortgage payments
    - Property taxes
    - HOA dues (unless specifically included)
    - Special assessments
    - Insurance premiums

    Some managers offer these services for additional fee. Most owners handle directly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tax reporting">
    Owner remains responsible for:

    - Accurate tax filings
    - Depreciation schedules
    - Capital gain calculations
    - 1099 review and verification

    Manager provides documentation; owner/accountant handles tax compliance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tenant approval">
    Depending on agreement, owners may:

    - Approve all tenants
    - Set criteria and delegate selection
    - Retain veto power
    - Approve only exceptions

    Clarify process in management agreement. Delays in approval cost vacancy time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rent pricing">
    Owner input on rent decisions:

    - Initial listing price

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Capital improvements">
    Major property decisions:

    - Renovations and upgrades
    - Appliance replacements
    - System replacements (HVAC, roof)
    - Property additions

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Eviction authorization">
    Owners typically must authorize:

    - Initiating eviction proceedings
