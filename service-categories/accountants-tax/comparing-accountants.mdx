Choosing the right tax professional affects both the accuracy of your returns and the quality of tax planning advice. For real estate matters, experience with property transactions often matters more than credentials alone.

Comparing multiple professionals before engaging helps ensure a good fit for your situation.

## What to Look For

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Real estate experience">
    Not all tax professionals have experience with property matters. Look for someone who regularly handles:

    - Rental property taxation
    - Capital gains and exclusions
    - 1031 exchanges
    - Cost basis tracking
    - Depreciation and recapture
    - Passive activity rules

    Ask specifically about real estate clients and transaction volume.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credentials">
    Consider credential level appropriate to your needs:

    - **CPA:** Broadest qualifications, can represent before IRS, handles complex situations
    - **Enrolled Agent:** Tax specialist, full IRS representation, often lower cost than CPA
    - **Tax Preparer:** Basic returns only, limited representation
    - **Tax Attorney:** Legal matters, litigation, criminal issues

    For most real estate investors, CPA or EA with property experience is ideal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Availability">
    Tax questions arise year-round, not just at filing time.

    - Can you reach them outside tax season?
    - Do they offer planning consultations?
    - How quickly do they respond to questions?
    - Will you work with the same person each year?
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Communication style">
    Find someone who explains things clearly:

    - Answers questions in plain language
    - Proactively identifies issues and opportunities
    - Responds promptly to calls and emails
    - Takes time to understand your situation

    Avoid professionals who make you feel rushed or confused.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Technology">
    Modern practices should offer:

    - Secure document upload portal
    - Electronic signature capability
    - Digital copies of returns
    - Organized record retention

    Paper-only practices may indicate outdated methods.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Questions to Ask

    - How many clients do you have with rental properties?
    - Have you handled 1031 exchanges?

    - How do you handle questions during the year?

    - Do fees increase with additional properties?
    - Is audit representation included or extra?

</AccordionGroup>

## Fee Structures

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Flat fee">
    Fixed price for defined scope of work. Common for straightforward returns.

    **Pros:** Predictable cost, no surprise bills 

    **Cons:** May not include additional questions or planning

    Clarify what's included and what triggers additional fees.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Per-form pricing">
    Charges based on number and complexity of forms filed.

    **Pros:** Pay for what you need \
    \
    **Cons:** Hard to predict total cost in advance

    More forms (rental properties, investments) means higher cost.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hourly billing">
    Charges based on time spent. Common for planning, complex issues, and representation.

    **Pros:** Pay only for actual work\
     \
    **Cons:** Unpredictable costs, may hesitate to ask questions

    Ask for estimate and request notification if exceeding.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Value pricing">
    Fee based on complexity and value provided rather than time.

    **Pros:** Aligned incentives, includes planning \
    \
    **Cons:** May be higher than hourly for simple situations

    Common with firms targeting real estate investors.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

| Service                                 | Typical Range    |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Individual return (simple)              | \$200 - \$400    |
| Individual return with rental           | \$400 - \$800    |

| Audit representation (hourly)           | \$150 - \$400    |

Costs vary by location, complexity, and professional credentials. Higher fees don't always mean better service.

<Note>
  Request fee estimate in writing before engaging. Clarify what's included and what would trigger additional charges.
</Note>

## Red Flags

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Guarantees refunds">
    No legitimate professional guarantees a refund before reviewing your situation. Refund depends on your facts, not their skill.

    Promises of specific outcomes suggest aggressive positions or outright fraud.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fees based on refund size">
    Charging percentage of refund creates incentive to inflate deductions or credits.

    IRS prohibits contingent fees for original return preparation. This practice is a major red flag.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Won't sign return">
    Paid preparers must sign returns and include their PTIN. Refusal to sign suggests they don't stand behind their work.

    You're responsible for accuracy regardless of who prepares return.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Doesn't ask questions">
    Good preparers ask questions to understand your situation. Someone who prepares returns without inquiry may miss deductions or make errors.

    Cookie-cutter approach doesn't work for real estate situations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pressures aggressive positions">
    Pushes deductions or positions that seem too good to be true. Aggressive positions create audit risk and potential penalties.

    Good professionals explain risks and let you decide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hard to reach">
    Doesn't return calls, takes weeks to respond, or disappears after filing season.

    You need someone available when questions arise, not just at tax time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  You are legally responsible for accuracy of your tax return even if someone else prepares it. Choose professionals carefully and review returns before signing.
</Warning>

## Interviewing Professionals

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Initial consultation">
    Many professionals offer free initial consultation. Use this to assess:

    - Communication style
    - Knowledge of your situation type
    - Interest in your business
    - Office organization and professionalism

    Come prepared with overview of your situation and specific questions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prepare your information">
    Bring or be ready to discuss:

    - Types of income (W-2, self-employment, rental)
    - Number of properties owned
    - Recent or planned transactions
    - Specific concerns or questions
    - Prior year returns if switching preparers
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Compare multiple options">
    Interview at least 2-3 professionals before deciding. Compare:

    - Relevant experience
    - Communication quality
    - Fee structure
    - Availability
    - Overall impression

    Cheapest option isn't always best value.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When to Switch Professionals

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Signs it's time to change">
    - Errors on returns requiring amendments
    - Missed deductions or opportunities
    - Poor communication or slow responses
    - Doesn't understand your situation
    - No proactive planning advice
    - Fees increased significantly without added value
    - Retired or sold practice to someone you don't know
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to switch">
    - Obtain copies of prior returns (at least 3 years)
    - Get depreciation schedules and basis documentation
    - Request any workpapers or supporting documents
    - Provide new preparer with complete history

    Prior preparer must provide copies of your returns. May charge reasonable fee for copies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Timing considerations">
    Best time to switch is after filing season (May-December). New preparer has time to review history before next filing.

    Switching mid-season is possible but may be rushed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Building a Long-Term Relationship

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Ongoing communication">
    Keep preparer informed of changes:

    - Property purchases or sales
    - Major improvements
    - Change in rental status
    - Life changes (marriage, divorce, retirement)
    - Business changes

    Surprises at tax time lead to rushed decisions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Year-round planning">
    Best tax outcomes come from planning, not just filing.

    - Schedule mid-year check-in
    - Discuss major transactions before completing
    - Review estimated tax payments
    - Plan year-end strategies
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Organized records">
    Make preparer's job easier:

    - Keep receipts organized by category
    - Track mileage contemporaneously
    - Maintain property files with purchase documents and improvements
    - Provide complete information, not piles of paper

    Better records mean more accurate returns and lower fees.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## DIY vs Professional

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When DIY may work">
    - Simple W-2 income only
    - Primary residence with standard deductions
    - No rental properties
    - Comfortable with tax software
    - Time to research and verify accuracy
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When professional is recommended">
    - Rental property ownership
    - Self-employment income
    - Investment property sales
    - 1031 exchanges
    - Complex situations or multiple income sources
    - Prior IRS issues or audits
    - High income with planning opportunities
    - Limited time or interest in tax matters
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hybrid approach">
    Some investors prepare returns themselves but consult professionals for:

    - Annual review of self-prepared return
    - Planning before major transactions
    - Specific questions or complex issues

    Can reduce costs while getting professional input on key decisions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **First meeting checklist:**

  - Verify credentials (CPA license, EA enrollment, PTIN)
  - Ask about real estate experience
  - Discuss fee structure and get estimate in writing
  - Clarify communication expectations
  - Ask about planning services beyond preparation
  - Request references from real estate clients
  - Trust your instincts about fit and professionalism
