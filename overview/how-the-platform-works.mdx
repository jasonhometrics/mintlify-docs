# How It Works

Hometrics operates as a searchable directory of real estate professionals with integrated review aggregation and communication tools. The platform connects consumers with service providers through three primary functions: discovery, evaluation, and engagement.

## Discovery

### Service Category Organization

The directory organizes professionals into 13 service categories covering all aspects of real estate transactions. Each category includes providers who offer related services within that vertical.

Service categories include:
- Title and escrow companies
- Mortgage lenders and loan officers
- Real estate agents and brokers
- Home inspectors
- Property appraisers
- Homeowners insurance agents
- Real estate attorneys
- Accountants and tax professionals
- Property managers
- Moving companies
- Home staging professionals
- Interior designers
- Real estate photographers and videographers

### Search and Filtering

Consumers can search by service type, location, and specific criteria relevant to each category. Search results display professionals ranked by review ratings, review volume, and other quality indicators.

Filters allow narrowing results by:
- Geographic area
- Specific services offered
- Years in business
- Transaction volume
- Licensing and credentials

## Evaluation

### Review Aggregation

Hometrics pulls reviews from Google Business Profiles and other verified sources. Reviews are not hosted on the platform but are aggregated and displayed with links to original sources.

Each professional profile shows:
- Overall rating (averaged across sources)
- Total number of reviews
- Recent review highlights
- Review distribution by star rating
- Links to full review sources

### Profile Information

Professional profiles display publicly available information including:
- Business name and location
- Services offered
- Years in business
- Licensing information
- Contact methods
- Transaction volume (when available)
- Credentials and certifications

Claimed profiles may include additional information that professionals choose to display such as team information, service area details, and specialty descriptions.

### Verification Badges

The platform assigns badges to indicate profile status and review authenticity:
- Verified business: Information confirmed through public records
- Claimed profile: Business owner has verified ownership and manages the profile
- Review authenticity: Patterns consistent with legitimate customer feedback

## Engagement

### Direct Messaging

Consumers can initiate conversations with professionals through an integrated messaging system. Initial contact does not require sharing phone numbers or email addresses.

The messaging flow:
1. Consumer sends message through platform
2. Professional receives notification and responds
3. Conversation continues through platform
4. Consumer shares contact information when ready

This approach prevents immediate call and email volume that typically follows traditional contact form submissions.

### Contact Information Sharing

When consumers decide to share contact details, they control timing and method. Options include:
- Sharing phone number for calls or texts
- Sharing email address for detailed correspondence
- Scheduling calls through integrated booking
- Requesting specific information before providing contact details

### Multi-Professional Research

Consumers can contact multiple professionals simultaneously to compare options. The platform supports parallel conversations without requiring separate form submissions or repeated information entry.

This enables the comparison approach recommended in buyer education content where consumers interview at least three options for each service type before hiring.

## For Professionals

### Profile Claiming

Professionals are automatically included in the directory based on public business information. Claiming a profile provides control over displayed information and enables response to reviews.

Claiming process:
1. Search for business name
2. Verify business ownership through documentation
3. Complete profile information
4. Enable messaging and response tools

### Review Management

Claimed profiles provide tools for review response and monitoring. Professionals can:
- Respond to reviews publicly
- Track review metrics over time
- Receive alerts for new reviews
- Generate review requests from customers

### Optional Services

Premium services are available for professionals who want to accelerate review generation or enhance profile visibility through legitimate means that comply with platform policies.

These services include automated review request systems, response templates, and performance analytics. All services maintain review authenticity requirements and do not manipulate rankings.

## Platform Integrity

### No Pay-to-Play Rankings

Profile visibility is determined by review ratings and volume. Payment does not affect search ranking position. Premium services enhance review collection efficiency but do not artificially boost placement.

### Review Authenticity Protection

The platform monitors for suspicious review patterns including:
- Sudden review volume spikes
- Review content similarity
- Timing patterns inconsistent with transaction flow
- Reviewer account patterns

Suspicious activity triggers review flags or temporary profile suspension pending investigation.

### Data Accuracy

Information is sourced from public records and verified sources. Professionals can correct inaccurate information through the profile claiming process. Changes to core business data require documentation.
