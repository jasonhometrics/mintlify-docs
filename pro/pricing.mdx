## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is this for individual agents or solo professionals?">
    Hometrics is built for businesses with consistent customer volume. Most customers process 10+ transactions per month. Individual agents with low volume are generally not a fit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do you post on my Google Business Profile?">
    No. Hometrics manages reputation and engagement but does not create posts or content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I respond to my own reviews?">
    Yes. You always retain full access to your Google Business Profile. Respond anytime, or let us handle responses for you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is this SEO or local search?">
    No. Hometrics is reputation management. The Authority plan includes listings management for NAP consistency, but does not include SEO services.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel anytime?">
    Yes. Monthly plans have no long-term contracts. Enterprise agreements may have different terms.
  </Accordion>
