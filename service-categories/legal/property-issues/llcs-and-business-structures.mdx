description: "Holding property in business entities"
---

Investors and property owners sometimes hold real estate in business entities like LLCs rather than their personal names. This can provide liability protection, tax flexibility, and estate planning benefits.

Business structures also create complications for financing, management, and ongoing compliance. Understanding tradeoffs helps owners make informed decisions.

## Why Use a Business Entity

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Liability protection">
    Separates personal assets from property liabilities. If someone is injured on the property and sues, they can typically only reach assets owned by the entity, not the owner's personal savings, home, or other property.

    Protection isn't absolute. Courts can "pierce the veil" if entity formalities aren't followed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tax flexibility">
    Certain structures allow pass-through taxation, deductions, or income splitting among multiple owners.

    Tax benefits depend on entity type, ownership structure, and individual circumstances.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Estate planning">
    Ownership interests can be transferred more easily than real property. Allows gradual transfer to heirs while maintaining control.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Privacy">
    In some states, LLC ownership isn't publicly disclosed. Property records show entity name, not individual owner.

    Privacy varies by state. Some require disclosure of members or managers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multiple owners">
    Entities provide clear structure for partnerships. Operating agreements define ownership percentages, responsibilities, and exit procedures.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Entity Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Limited Liability Company (LLC)">
    Most popular for real estate. Combines liability protection with tax flexibility.

    **Pros:**

    - Limited liability for members
    - Pass-through taxation (no double taxation)
    - Flexible management structure
    - Fewer formalities than corporations

    **Cons:**

    - Financing can be more difficult
    - Annual fees and filings required
    - Self-employment tax may apply
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Series LLC">
    Special LLC structure allowing separate "series" within one entity. Each series has its own assets and liabilities.

    Available in some states (Delaware, Texas, Illinois, others). Allows multiple properties in one LLC with liability separation between them.

    Not recognized in all states. Consult attorney before using.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limited Partnership (LP)">
    Has general partners (manage and have liability) and limited partners (passive investors with limited liability).

    Common for syndications and larger investments. General partner often an LLC for liability protection.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="S Corporation">
    Provides liability protection with pass-through taxation. Potential self-employment tax savings for active businesses.

    Less common for holding rental property due to restrictions and complexity. Better suited for active real estate businesses (flipping, development).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="C Corporation">
    Separate tax entity. Profits taxed at corporate level, then again when distributed to shareholders (double taxation).

    Rarely used for real estate investment due to tax disadvantages. May be appropriate for specific situations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Land Trust">
    Property held by trustee for benefit of beneficiary. Provides privacy and simplifies transfers.

    Not a business entity. Does not provide liability protection on its own. Often combined with LLC (LLC as beneficiary of land trust).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  For most individual investors with rental properties, a single-member LLC provides adequate protection with minimal complexity. Larger portfolios or partnerships may benefit from more sophisticated structures.
</Note>

## Forming an LLC

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a state">
    Most owners form LLCs in the state where property is located. Forming in another state (Delaware, Wyoming) requires also registering in property's state, adding cost and complexity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a name">
    Must be unique in the state and include "LLC" or "Limited Liability Company." Check availability with state filing office.
  </Step>
  <Step title="File articles of organization">
    Submit formation document to state (usually Secretary of State). Filing fees range from 50 to 500 depending on state.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create operating agreement">
    Internal document defining ownership, management, distributions, and procedures. Not filed with state but essential for liability protection and clarity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get EIN">
    Obtain Employer Identification Number from IRS. Free. Required for bank accounts and tax filing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open bank account">
    Separate account for LLC funds. Essential for maintaining liability protection. Never mix personal and LLC funds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transfer property">
    Deed property from personal name to LLC. Record with county. May have transfer tax and mortgage implications.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Financing Challenges

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Residential mortgages">
    Most residential lenders don't lend to LLCs. Conventional, FHA, and VA loans require individual borrowers.

    Common workaround: Purchase in personal name, transfer to LLC after closing. Check loan documents for due-on-sale clause.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Due-on-sale clause">
    Most mortgages allow lender to demand full payment if property is transferred. Transferring to LLC technically triggers this clause.

    In practice, lenders rarely enforce if payments continue. But the risk exists.

    Some argue Garn-St. Germain Act protects transfers to LLCs owned by borrower. Legal interpretation varies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Commercial loans">
    Lenders that finance LLCs typically require:

    - Personal guarantee from members
    - Higher interest rates
    - Larger down payments (25-30%+)
    - Stronger financial documentation

    Personal guarantee reduces liability protection benefit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Refinancing">
    May need to transfer property out of LLC to refinance with residential loan, then transfer back. Creates costs and risks.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Transferring mortgaged property to an LLC without lender consent violates most loan agreements. While enforcement is rare, the lender could demand full repayment. Consult with attorney before transferring.
</Warning>

## Maintaining Liability Protection

LLC protection requires treating the entity as separate from yourself.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Formalities to follow">
    - Keep separate bank accounts
    - Never mix personal and LLC funds
    - Sign contracts as LLC, not personally
    - Maintain adequate insurance
    - File annual reports and fees
    - Keep meeting minutes (if required by state)
    - Use LLC name on all property documents
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Piercing the corporate veil">
    Courts can ignore LLC protection if:

    - Funds are commingled
    - Entity is undercapitalized
    - Formalities aren't followed
    - LLC is used to commit fraud
    - Owner treats LLC as personal alter ego

    Proper setup and ongoing compliance are essential.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Insurance still matters">
    LLC protection is a backup, not a replacement for insurance. Adequate liability coverage should be first line of defense.

    Consider umbrella policy in addition to property insurance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Operating Agreements

Operating agreement is the internal rulebook for LLC management.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Key provisions">
    - Ownership percentages
    - Capital contributions
    - Profit and loss allocation
    - Distribution rules
    - Management structure
    - Voting rights
    - Transfer restrictions
    - Dissolution procedures
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Single-member LLCs">
    Even with one owner, operating agreement documents intent to maintain separation and establishes procedures if ownership changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multi-member LLCs">
    Essential for partnerships. Defines decision-making, handles disputes, and sets exit procedures. Without agreement, state default rules apply.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tax Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Default taxation">
    Single-member LLCs taxed as sole proprietorship (disregarded entity). Multi-member LLCs taxed as partnership. Income passes through to personal returns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Electing corporate taxation">
    LLCs can elect to be taxed as S-Corp or C-Corp. May provide benefits in specific situations. Adds complexity.

    Consult tax professional before making election.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Self-employment tax">
    LLC rental income is generally not subject to self-employment tax if owner is passive investor.

    Active real estate businesses (flipping, development) may face self-employment tax.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deductions">
    Same deductions available whether property held personally or in LLC: depreciation, mortgage interest, repairs, property taxes, etc.

    LLC doesn't create additional deductions for rental property.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Multiple Properties

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="One LLC per property">
    Maximum protection. Liability from one property doesn't affect others.

    Adds cost and complexity. Annual fees and filings for each entity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="All properties in one LLC">
    Simpler and cheaper. One set of filings and fees.

    Less protection. Lawsuit on one property puts all properties at risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Series LLC">
    Middle ground where available. One LLC with separate series for each property.

    Lower cost than multiple LLCs with similar protection. Not available in all states.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Holding company structure">
    Parent LLC owns individual property LLCs. Provides protection plus centralized management.

    More complex. Typically for larger portfolios.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Is an LLC Right for You?

**LLC may make sense if:**

- Owning rental property
- Multiple properties or significant equity
