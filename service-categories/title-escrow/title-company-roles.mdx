Title companies are local businesses that handle the legal and financial aspects of property transfers. They research ownership, issue insurance policies, hold funds in escrow, and coordinate closings.

Understanding who works at a title company and what they do clarifies communication and expectations throughout the transaction.

## Title Company vs Title Underwriter

**Title Company** The local business handling the transaction. Title companies employ processors, examiners, and closers who work directly with buyers, sellers, agents, and lenders. They coordinate the transaction from contract to closing.

**Title Underwriter** The insurance company that backs title insurance policies. Underwriters provide the financial guarantee behind policies issued by local title companies. When claims arise, the underwriter pays. Title companies are typically affiliated with one or more underwriters and issue policies on their behalf.

Think of it like a local insurance agent (title company) selling policies from a national carrier (underwriter).

## Roles at a Title Company

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Processor">
    **What they do:** Coordinate documentation and communication between all parties. They gather required items, track deadlines, and keep the transaction moving forward.

    **When they're involved:** From contract execution through closing.

    **Client interaction:** Often the primary point of contact. May request documentation, provide updates, and answer general questions about transaction status.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Title Examiner">
    **What they do:** Research public records to verify ownership history. They search for liens, judgments, easements, and any claims against the property. Their findings determine whether title is "clear" and insurable.

    **When they're involved:** After contract execution, before closing.

    **Client interaction:** Rarely direct. Findings are communicated through processors or closers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Escrow Officer">
    **What they do:** Manage the escrow account holding transaction funds. They receive deposits, coordinate with lenders, verify fund amounts, and prepare disbursement instructions.

    **When they're involved:** From earnest money deposit through final disbursement after closing.

    **Client interaction:** May contact parties about wire instructions, fund verification, or disbursement questions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Closer">
    **What they do:** Conduct the closing appointment. They guide parties through document signing, ensure all required signatures are obtained, and verify identification.

    **When they're involved:** Closing day.

    **Client interaction:** Direct interaction during the signing appointment.

## About Closers

The closer role can be filled by different professionals depending on state requirements and company practices:

**Settlement Agent** A licensed professional employed by the title company who specializes in real estate closings. Can explain documents, answer transaction questions, and guide the signing process.

**Attorney** A licensed attorney who conducts closings. Some states require attorney involvement. Some title agencies are attorney-owned and conduct all closings with an attorney present. Attorneys can provide legal advice and answer questions about contract terms.

**Notary** A commissioned official who witnesses signatures and verifies identity. Notaries confirm signers are who they claim to be. They cannot explain documents or answer questions about the transaction.

<Warning>
  **Skill level varies by closer type.**

  Attorneys and settlement agents are trained to answer questions about the loan documents at closing. Notaries are there to witness a signature. Before closing, ask: "Who will conduct my closing and can they answer questions?"
</Warning>

## Questions to Ask

**"Who will be my main contact during the transaction?"** Clarifies whether communication goes through a processor, closer, or other staff member.

**"Who conducts your closings?"** Determines whether closings are handled by settlement agents, attorneys, or notaries.

**"Do you offer attorney settlements?"** Some companies provide this option. May be standard, available for additional cost, or not offered.

**"What if I have questions during the signing?"** If a notary conducts closing, questions cannot be answered on the spot.
