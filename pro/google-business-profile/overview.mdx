Google Business Profile (GBP) is a free tool that allows businesses to manage their presence across Google Search and Google Maps. It controls how business information appears when consumers search for the business by name or discover it through local searches.

GBP serves as the primary data source for Google's local search results, the <Tooltip tip="The group of 3-4 local business results displayed with a map in search results">Map Pack</Tooltip>, and many [AI-powered search tools](/pro/local-search/how-search-is-changing). For local businesses, it is the single most influential listing platform.

## Why GBP Matters

Google dominates search market share, making GBP the most visible listing for most businesses:

### GBP Influence on Search Results

When someone searches for a local service, Google displays results in several formats:

| Result Type | GBP Influence |
|-------------|---------------|
| Map Pack (Local Pack) | Primary data source for all displayed information |
| Knowledge Panel | Business details pulled directly from GBP |
| Organic results | GBP signals influence local organic rankings |
| Google Maps | Entire listing powered by GBP |
| Voice responses | Google Assistant reads from GBP data |

<Info>
A complete, optimized GBP improves visibility across all of these result types. An incomplete or inaccurate profile limits visibility or displays wrong information to potential clients.

## Eligibility Requirements

GBP is available to businesses that meet specific criteria:

### Eligible Businesses

- Physical storefronts where customers visit
- Service-area businesses that travel to customers
- Hybrid businesses with both storefront and service-area operations

### Ineligible Uses

- Online-only businesses with no physical presence
- Lead generation listings without real businesses behind them
- Listings for individuals rather than businesses
- Virtual offices or mail-only addresses (with limited exceptions)

<Warning>
Creating GBP listings for ineligible businesses or using fake addresses violates Google's guidelines and can result in listing suspension. This applies even if the business is legitimate but does not meet physical location requirements.
</Warning>

## GBP and Hometrics

Hometrics displays businesses from Google Business Profile as the foundation of its directory. The review data, business information, and photos visible on Hometrics originate from GBP.

### How the Connection Works

```
Google Business Profile
         ↓
   Business Data + Reviews
         ↓
      Hometrics
         ↓
   Enhanced Directory Listing
   (badges, comparisons, local context)
```

<Check>
Optimizing a Google Business Profile improves visibility both on Google and on Hometrics. The same information that helps consumers find a business through Google search also populates the Hometrics directory listing.

### What Hometrics Adds

While GBP provides the foundation, Hometrics adds:

- [Performance badges](/overview/platform-features/performance-badges) based on review analysis
- Side-by-side comparison with other local providers

## GBP vs. Other Listings

GBP requires more attention than other listings due to its impact and complexity:

| Aspect | GBP | Other Listings |
|--------|-----|----------------|
| Visibility impact | Highest | Varies by platform |
| Features | Extensive | Usually basic |
| User contributions | Reviews, photos, Q&A, edits | Usually reviews only |
| Update frequency needed | Weekly to monthly | Quarterly |
| Monitoring required | Ongoing | Periodic |

<Tip>
Businesses should check their GBP at least weekly for suggested edits, new reviews, questions, and messages. Other listings need less frequent attention.
