title: "Due Diligence"
description: "Inspections and appraisals that protect you before you commit"
---

Due diligence is the investigation period after your offer is accepted. This is when you verify the property's condition and value before fully committing. Two evaluations happen during this phase: the home inspection (your protection) and the appraisal (the lender's protection).

## Inspection vs Appraisal

These are different evaluations serving different purposes.

| | Home Inspection | Appraisal |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Assess condition | Determine value |
| **Who orders** | Buyer | Lender |
| **Who pays** | Buyer | Buyer |
| **Required** | No (but standard) | Yes (for mortgage) |
| **Focus** | Defects and safety | Market value |
| **Timeline** | 7-14 days after contract | 7-14 days after contract |
| **Report use** | Negotiation, decision-making | Loan approval |

Both happen during roughly the same timeframe, but they serve completely different functions.

## Home Inspection

The home inspection evaluates the property's physical condition. An inspector examines accessible areas and systems, documenting defects, safety concerns, and maintenance issues.

### What Inspectors Evaluate

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Structure and foundation">
    Foundation walls, floor framing, support beams, signs of settling or movement, structural integrity.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Roof and exterior">
    Roof covering condition, flashing, gutters, siding, windows, doors, grading and drainage around the foundation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Electrical systems">
    Service panel, wiring type and condition, outlets, switches, GFCI protection, safety concerns.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Plumbing">
    Water supply lines, drain lines, water heater, fixtures, water pressure, visible leaks.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="HVAC">
    Heating and cooling systems, ductwork, filters, thermostat operation, age and condition.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Interior">
    Walls, ceilings, floors, stairs, railings, windows, doors, built-in appliances.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Insulation and ventilation">
    Attic insulation, vapor barriers, ventilation in attic and crawl spaces.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
Home inspections are visual examinations of accessible areas. Inspectors cannot see through walls, identify hidden defects, or predict future problems. They report what is visible on inspection day.
</Note>

### Specialty Inspections

General inspections don't cover everything. Depending on the property, you may need additional specialty inspections.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Radon testing">
    Tests for radioactive gas that can accumulate in basements. Common in many regions. Mitigation is straightforward if levels are high.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Termite/pest inspection">
    Identifies wood-destroying insects and damage. Often required by lenders. May be performed by general inspector or separate specialist.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sewer line scope">
    Camera inspection of sewer line from house to street. Identifies breaks, root intrusion, bellies, or deterioration. Repairs can cost thousands.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Mold assessment">
    If moisture issues are suspected or visible. Identifies mold presence and extent. May require remediation before closing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Chimney inspection">
    For homes with fireplaces. Evaluates flue condition, liner, cap, and structural integrity.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Well and septic">
    For properties not on municipal water/sewer. Tests water quality and evaluates septic system function. Often required by lenders.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Pool and spa">
    Evaluates equipment, surfaces, safety features, and structural condition of pools or spas.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Scheduling and Timing

Schedule your inspection immediately after your offer is accepted. Don't wait.

**Why timing matters:**

- Inspection contingency is typically 7-14 days
- Inspectors may not have immediate availability
- You need time to review the report
- You need time to negotiate if issues are found
- Specialty inspections take additional time

Waiting until day 10 of a 14-day contingency leaves almost no time to respond to findings.

### What Happens After Inspection

The inspection report documents findings. You then decide how to proceed.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Accept property as-is">
    Proceed without requesting changes. Appropriate when issues are minor or already reflected in price.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Request repairs">
    Ask seller to fix specific issues before closing. Common for safety issues, major system problems, and code violations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Request credit">
    Ask for price reduction or closing cost credit instead of repairs. Gives you control over how and when repairs are made.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Terminate">
    Cancel the contract and receive earnest money back. Appropriate when issues are too significant or seller won't negotiate.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Seller responses to requests:**

- Agree to all requests
- Agree to some, decline others
- Offer credit instead of repairs
- Refuse all requests

If the seller refuses to address significant issues, you must decide whether to proceed as-is or terminate under your contingency.

<Warning>
Walking away is sometimes the right decision. The inspection contingency exists to protect you from unacceptable conditions. Don't let emotional attachment push you into a bad purchase.
</Warning>

### What to Negotiate

Focus negotiation on significant issues, not cosmetic concerns.

**Typically negotiated:**
- Safety hazards (electrical, structural, health)
- Major system problems (HVAC, plumbing, roof)
- Code violations
- Deferred maintenance with significant cost
- Issues affecting insurability or financing

**Typically not negotiated:**
- Cosmetic issues
- Normal wear and tear
- Minor maintenance items
- Personal preferences

## Appraisal

The appraisal determines the property's market value for the lender. This protects the lender by confirming the property is worth at least as much as the loan amount.

### How Appraisals Work

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who orders it">
    The lender orders the appraisal and selects the appraiser. You cannot choose your own appraiser for a mortgage transaction.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What appraisers do">
    Appraisers visit the property, measure and photograph it, note its condition and features, then research comparable sales to determine market value.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Timeline">
    Typically 7-14 days from order to completed report. Scheduling, inspection, research, and report preparation all take time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cost">
    You pay for the appraisal as part of your loan costs. Typically $400-$700 for standard residential properties.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### When the Appraisal Comes in Low

If the appraisal is lower than the purchase price, there's a gap between what you agreed to pay and what the lender will finance.

**Example:**
- Purchase price: $400,000
- Appraisal value: $380,000
- Gap: $20,000

The lender will only base your loan on the appraised value. You must address the $20,000 difference.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Renegotiate purchase price">
    Ask the seller to reduce the price to match appraised value. Sellers may agree to avoid losing the deal.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Pay the difference in cash">
    Bring additional funds to cover the gap. Requires available cash beyond your original down payment.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Split the difference">
    Negotiate with seller to meet somewhere in the middle. You bring some additional cash, seller reduces price.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Challenge the appraisal">
    Request reconsideration of value with additional comparable sales data. Not always successful.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Terminate">
    If you have an appraisal contingency and cannot reach agreement, you can terminate and receive earnest money back.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
If you waived the appraisal contingency, you must cover any gap with cash or lose your earnest money. This is why waiving appraisal contingency requires significant cash reserves.
</Note>
