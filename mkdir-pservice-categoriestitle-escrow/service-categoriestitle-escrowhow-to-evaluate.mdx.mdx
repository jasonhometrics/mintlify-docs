# How to Evaluate Title Companies

<Tip>
Interview at least 3 title companies before choosing. The differences in security protocols, experience, and fees can save or cost you thousands.
</Tip>

## Critical Questions to Ask

### Wire Fraud Protection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do you carry wire fraud insurance?" icon="shield-check">
    **What you're looking for:** Minimum $1M coverage
    
    **Why it matters:** If their email gets hacked and you wire funds to scammers, insurance is your only recovery option. No insurance = you eat the loss.
    
    **Red flag:** "We've never had an incident" is not insurance. Get the policy details in writing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do you communicate wiring instructions?" icon="lock">
    **What you're looking for:** 
    - Encrypted portal for document sharing
    - Phone verification required before wiring
    - No wiring instructions sent via email
    
    **Why it matters:** Email is easily hacked. If they email instructions, you're vulnerable.
    
    **Red flag:** "We'll email you the details" means walk away.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's your process if I receive unexpected wiring instructions?" icon="phone">
    **What you're looking for:** Clear protocol—call using number from their website (not from email), verify with specific person, double-check account numbers.
    
    **Why it matters:** Scammers send urgent emails saying "account changed, wire here immediately." Good title companies train you on how to verify.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Experience & Competence

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many closings do you handle monthly?" icon="chart-line">
    **What you're looking for:** 30+ closings per month shows established operation
    
    **Why it matters:** High volume = experienced team, established processes, relationships with local lenders and attorneys. Low volume = you're their practice run.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does your title search typically take?" icon="clock">
    **What you're looking for:** 7-14 days for standard search
    
    **Why it matters:** Faster isn't always better (rushed searches miss issues), but excessively slow indicates inefficiency that could delay your closing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Who will handle my closing?" icon="user-tie">
    **What you're looking for:** Licensed settlement agent or attorney, not a notary
    
    **Why it matters:** Settlement agents can explain documents and answer questions. Notaries can only witness signatures—if something's wrong, they can't help.
    
    **Red flag:** "We use mobile notaries for closings" means no licensed professional present.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Have you worked with my lender before?" icon="handshake">
    **What you're looking for:** Yes, or willingness to coordinate closely
    
    **Why it matters:** Title company and lender must communicate constantly. If they've worked together, fewer surprises.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Communication & Support

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who is my main point of contact?" icon="address-card">
    **What you're looking for:** Specific person's name, direct phone, email
    
    **Why it matters:** Generic "info@" emails and main office numbers mean you're in a queue. Direct contact means accountability.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How quickly do you respond to questions?" icon="message">
    **What you're looking for:** Same business day, within 24 hours maximum
    
    **Why it matters:** Real estate moves fast. Delayed responses cost you leverage and can kill deals.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are you available evenings/weekends?" icon="calendar">
    **What you're looking for:** At least email/text availability outside business hours
    
    **Why it matters:** Closings happen when both parties can meet—often evenings or weekends. Inflexibility causes delays.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Green Flags

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Proactive Communication" icon="bell">
    They explain their process upfront, send regular updates, and flag potential issues before they become problems.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Security Obsessed" icon="user-lock">
    They talk about wire fraud prevention without you asking. They make verification inconvenient on purpose—that's good.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Transparent Fees" icon="receipt">
    They provide itemized fee breakdown immediately, not "we'll figure it out at closing."
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Local Expertise" icon="location-dot">
    They know county-specific requirements, local recording fees, and have relationships with area lenders.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Red Flags

<Warning>
Any of these should make you walk away:
</Warning>

- No wire fraud insurance or won't provide proof of coverage
- Sends wiring instructions via unsecured email
- Significantly cheaper than competitors (cutting corners somewhere)
- Poor reviews mentioning wire fraud, lost deposits, or delayed closings
- Vague about who handles closing ("one of our notaries")
- Can't provide references from recent buyers
- Unwilling to answer security questions
- Pressure to wire funds immediately without verification

## How to Compare Options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Security First">
    **1. Wire fraud insurance coverage**
    
    **2. Communication security (encrypted portal vs email)**
    
    **3. Verification protocols**
    
    This matters more than price. A $500 difference in fees is irrelevant if you lose $50K to wire fraud.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Experience Matters">
    **1. Monthly closing volume**
    
    **2. Years in business**
    
    **3. Licensed settlement agent at closing**
    
    **4. Relationship with your lender**
    
    High-volume companies have seen every scenario. They know how to prevent and solve problems.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Service Quality">
    **1. Response time**
    
    **2. Dedicated contact person**
    
    **3. Evening/weekend availability**
    
    **4. Google reviews from past 12 months**
    
    You're wiring tens of thousands of dollars. You deserve responsive, professional service.
