Homeowners insurance policies bundle several types of coverage into one package. Each component protects against different risks and has its own coverage limit.

Understanding what each coverage type does helps homeowners ensure adequate protection across all categories.

## Coverage Components

Standard homeowners policies include six main coverage types, typically labeled A through F.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Coverage A: Dwelling">
    Covers the physical structure of your home, including:

    - Walls, roof, and foundation
    - Built-in appliances
    - Attached structures (garage, deck, porch)
    - Electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems
    - Permanently installed fixtures

    **How much you need:** Coverage should equal the cost to rebuild your home at current construction prices. This is not the same as market value or purchase price.

    Land value is not included since land doesn't need rebuilding.

    Covers detached structures on your property:

    - Detached garage
    - Storage shed
    - Fence
    - Guest house

    Covers minor medical expenses for guests injured on your property, regardless of fault:

## Dwelling Coverage Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Replacement cost vs market value">
    **Replacement cost:** What it costs to rebuild your home with similar materials and quality. This is what you should insure.

    **Market value:** What your home would sell for. Includes land value and market conditions.

    A home might sell for \$500,000 but cost only \$350,000 to rebuild (land worth \$150,000). Insure for \$350,000.

    Conversely, rebuilding costs may exceed market value in some areas.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Guaranteed vs extended replacement cost">
    **Guaranteed replacement cost:** Insurer pays full rebuilding cost even if it exceeds policy limit. Best protection but increasingly rare.

    **Extended replacement cost:** Pays 20-50% above policy limit if needed. Common option providing buffer for cost overruns.

    **Standard replacement cost:** Pays up to policy limit only. If rebuilding costs exceed limit, you pay the difference.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Building code upgrades">
    Older homes may not meet current building codes. After major damage, rebuilding must meet current codes.

    Standard policies may not cover the extra cost of code compliance. Ordinance or law coverage (endorsement) covers this gap.

    Important for older homes where code upgrades could add significant cost.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Construction costs have risen significantly in recent years. Review dwelling coverage annually to ensure it reflects current rebuilding costs, not the amount when you purchased the policy.
</Note>

## Personal Property Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Replacement cost vs ACV">
    **Replacement cost:** Pays to replace items at current prices.

    **Actual cash value (ACV):** Pays depreciated value. A 5-year-old TV worth \$1,000 new might pay only \$400.

    Replacement cost coverage is worth the additional premium for most homeowners.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Coverage limits for specific items">
    Standard policies cap coverage for certain categories:

    | Item Category       | Typical Limit     |
    | ------------------- | ----------------- |
    | Jewelry and watches | \$1,000 - \$2,000 |
    | Firearms            | \$2,000 - \$3,000 |
    | Silverware          | \$2,500           |
    | Electronics         | \$5,000           |
    | Cash                | \$200             |
    | Securities          | \$1,500           |
    | Business equipment  | \$2,500           |

    Items exceeding these limits need scheduled coverage (separate rider).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Home inventory">
    Document belongings before a loss occurs:

    - Photograph or video each room
    - Keep receipts for major purchases
    - List high-value items with serial numbers
    - Store inventory off-site or in cloud
    - Update after major purchases

    Detailed inventory speeds claims and ensures you don't forget items.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Off-premises coverage">
    Personal property coverage typically extends beyond your home:

    - Belongings in your car
    - Items at a storage unit
    - Possessions while traveling
    - Property at college dorm (for dependents)

    Usually limited to 10% of personal property coverage when off-premises.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Liability Coverage Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's covered">
    - Slip and fall injuries on your property
    - Dog bites (breed restrictions vary)
    - Injuries from recreational equipment (trampoline, pool)
    - Accidents caused by family members
    - Damage you cause to others' property
    - Legal defense costs (even if lawsuit is frivolous)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's not covered">
    - Intentional acts
    - Business activities
    - Auto accidents (covered by auto insurance)
    - Injuries to household members
    - Workers (need workers comp)
    - Certain dog breeds (varies by insurer)
    - Some high-risk activities
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How much to carry">
    Standard limits (\$100,000 - \$300,000) may be inadequate if you have significant assets.

    **Consider higher limits if:**

    - Net worth exceeds standard limit
    - Own rental properties
    - Have pool, trampoline, or dog
    - Entertain frequently
    - Have teenage drivers

    Umbrella policy provides additional liability coverage beyond homeowners and auto limits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Defense costs">
    Policy pays legal defense costs even if lawsuit has no merit. Defense costs typically don't reduce your coverage limit.

    Legal fees can exceed \$50,000 even for cases that are eventually dismissed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Liability coverage protects your assets beyond your home. A serious injury lawsuit can result in judgments of \$500,000 or more. Standard limits may leave you personally responsible for amounts exceeding coverage.
</Warning>

## Loss of Use Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When it applies">
    Covers additional expenses when home is uninhabitable due to covered loss. Must be a covered peril under your policy.

    - Percentage of dwelling coverage (20-30%)
    - Fixed dollar amount
    - Time period (12 or 24 months)

    Extended repairs can exceed limits quickly in high cost-of-living areas.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Adjusting Coverage Limits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When to increase">
    - Dwelling coverage doesn't reflect rebuilding costs
    - Home improvements or additions
    - Personal property exceeds standard limits
    - High-value items need scheduling

    - Added pool, trampoline, or dog
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When standard may be adequate">
    - Minimal belongings
    - No high-value items
    - Few assets to protect
    - Low-risk property (no pool, common breed dog)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cost of additional coverage">
    Increasing limits is often inexpensive relative to protection provided.

    > **Examples:**
    >
    > - Doubling liability from \$100,000 to \$300,000 may add \$20 to \$50 annually
    > - Replacement cost on personal property may add 10-15% to premium
    > - Extended replacement cost may add \$50 to \$100 annually
