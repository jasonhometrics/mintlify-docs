description: "Rental contract terms for landlords and tenants"
---

A lease agreement is a legally binding contract between a landlord and tenant for the rental of property. It defines the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of both parties for the duration of the tenancy.

Understanding lease terms protects both landlords and tenants from disputes and unexpected obligations.

## Lease vs Rental Agreement

**Lease**
Fixed-term agreement, typically 12 months. Terms remain constant throughout the period. Neither party can change terms or terminate early without cause or penalty.

**Month-to-month rental agreement**
Automatically renews each month. Either party can terminate with proper notice (typically 30 days). Landlord can change terms with notice.

Both are legally binding. The choice affects flexibility and stability for both parties.

## Rules and Restrictions

Leases typically include rules governing tenant conduct and property use.

**Common restrictions:**

| Area | Typical Rules |
|------|---------------|
| Occupancy | Maximum occupants, guest policies |
| Pets | Allowed/prohibited, deposits, restrictions |
| Smoking | Where permitted or prohibited |
| Noise | Quiet hours, disturbance policies |
| Parking | Assigned spaces, guest parking |
| Alterations | What changes require permission |
| Business use | Home business restrictions |
| Subletting | Whether allowed and requirements |

<Note>
Rules must be applied consistently to all tenants. Selectively enforcing rules against specific tenants may violate fair housing laws.
</Note>

## Landlord Obligations

Leases and state law require landlords to:

**Habitability**
- Maintain safe, livable conditions
- Provide working plumbing, heating, electrical
- Keep common areas clean and safe
- Address pest infestations
- Comply with building codes

**Repairs**
- Make necessary repairs within reasonable time
- Respond to emergency maintenance promptly
- Maintain appliances included in lease

**Privacy**
- Provide proper notice before entry (typically 24-48 hours)
- Enter only for legitimate purposes
- Respect tenant's quiet enjoyment

**Security deposits**
- Return deposits within state-required timeframe
- Provide itemized deduction statements
- Hold deposits as required by state law

## Tenant Obligations

Leases typically require tenants to:

**Payment**
- Pay rent on time
- Pay utilities as agreed
- Pay for damages beyond normal wear

**Property care**
- Keep unit clean and sanitary
- Dispose of trash properly
- Report maintenance issues promptly
- Not damage property intentionally
- Not disturb other tenants

**Compliance**
- Follow lease rules
- Comply with building rules
- Not engage in illegal activity
- Allow landlord access with proper notice
- Not sublet without permission

## Maintenance and Repairs

Leases should clarify maintenance responsibilities.

**Typically landlord responsibility:**
- Structural repairs
- Major systems (HVAC, plumbing, electrical)
- Appliances provided by landlord
- Common areas
- Pest control (in most states)

**Typically tenant responsibility:**
- Light bulbs
- Minor unclogging (depending on cause)
- Damage caused by tenant
- Appliances owned by tenant
- Lawn care (single-family, if specified)

**Emergency repairs:**
Leases should specify how to report emergencies and expected response times. Emergencies typically include:
- No heat in winter
- No water
- Gas leaks
- Flooding
- Broken locks or security issues

## Termination and Renewal

**End of lease term:**
- Some leases require notice to terminate even at end of term
- Others auto-renew without notice
- Many convert to month-to-month

**Early termination:**
Tenants may be able to terminate early with:
- Early termination fee (often 1-2 months rent)
- Finding replacement tenant
- Mutual agreement with landlord
- Legal justification (habitability, military deployment, domestic violence in some states)

Breaking lease without cause typically results in liability for remaining rent, though landlords must mitigate damages by seeking new tenants.

**Non-renewal:**
Landlords can typically decline to renew at lease end without cause (except where prohibited by local rent control). Proper notice is required.

## Security Deposit Terms

Security deposits are heavily regulated by state law.

**State limits:**
Many states cap deposits at 1-2 months' rent. Know your state's limit.

**Allowable deductions:**
- Unpaid rent
- Damage beyond normal wear and tear
- Cleaning if unit not left reasonably clean
- Unreturned keys or access devices
- Other costs specified in lease and allowed by law

**Normal wear vs damage:**
- Faded paint from sunlight: wear
- Holes in walls: damage
- Worn carpet in traffic areas: wear
- Stained carpet from spills: damage
- Loose door handles from use: wear
- Broken windows: damage

**Return timeline:**
States require return within specific periods (typically 14-30 days). Landlords must provide itemized deduction lists.

<Warning>
Security deposit violations can result in penalties. Many states allow tenants to recover 2-3 times the deposit amount if landlords fail to follow proper procedures.
</Warning>

## Problematic Lease Terms

Some lease provisions may be unenforceable or signal problems.

**Potentially unenforceable:**
- Waiving landlord's duty to maintain habitability
- Waiving tenant's right to sue
- Excessive late fees
- Automatic lease renewal without notice
- Waiving security deposit protections
- Unreasonable entry provisions

**Red flags:**
- No written lease (risky for both parties)
- Vague or missing terms
- One-sided provisions favoring only landlord
- Excessive fees for everything
- Unreasonable restrictions
- Penalties without cure periods
