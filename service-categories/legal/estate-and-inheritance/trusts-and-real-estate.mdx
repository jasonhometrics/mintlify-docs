A trust is a legal arrangement where one party (trustee) holds property for the benefit of another (beneficiary). Trusts are commonly used to avoid probate, protect assets, and control how property passes to heirs.

Understanding how trusts work helps property owners decide if this planning tool fits their situation.

## How Trusts Work

A trust involves three roles:

- **Grantor/Settlor:** Person who creates the trust and transfers property into it
- **Trustee:** Person or entity managing trust property according to trust terms
- **Beneficiary:** Person who receives benefits from trust property

With living trusts, the same person often fills all three roles during their lifetime. After death, successor trustees and beneficiaries take over.

## Types of Trusts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Revocable Living Trust">
    Most common for real estate planning. Grantor maintains full control during lifetime—can change terms, remove property, or dissolve entirely.

    **Pros:** Avoids probate, maintains privacy, easy to modify 

    **Cons:** No asset protection, no tax benefits during lifetime

    After grantor's death, becomes irrevocable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Irrevocable Trust">
    Cannot be changed or dissolved once created (with limited exceptions). Property is permanently removed from grantor's estate.

    **Pros:** Asset protection, potential estate tax benefits, Medicaid planning 

    **Cons:** Loss of control, difficult to modify, complex setup

    Used for specific planning goals, not general probate avoidance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Testamentary Trust">
    Created by will and takes effect after death. Property goes through probate first, then into trust.

    **Pros:** Can control inheritance for minors or spendthrift beneficiaries 

    **Cons:** Doesn't avoid probate

    Common for leaving property to minor children.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Transferring Property Into a Trust

For a trust to work, property must actually be transferred into it. This is called "funding" the trust.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The Deed">
    Transferring real estate requires a new deed from the owner (grantor) to the trustee of the trust.

    Example: "John Smith" becomes "John Smith, Trustee of the John Smith Living Trust dated January 1, 2025"

    Deed must be recorded with the county.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Common Mistake: Unfunded Trusts">
    Creating a trust document without transferring property into it accomplishes nothing. The trust exists but owns nothing. Property still goes through probate.

    This is the most common trust planning failure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Title Insurance Considerations">
    Some title companies require specific trust documentation before insuring property in a trust. May need trust certificate or full trust document copy.

    Notify your title company before closing if purchasing into a trust.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  A trust only controls property that's actually in the trust. If you create a living trust but never deed your house into it, the house still goes through probate at death.
</Warning>

## Benefits for Real Estate

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Probate Avoidance">
    Property in a trust passes directly to beneficiaries without court involvement. Faster, cheaper, and private compared to probate.

    Particularly valuable in states with slow or expensive probate processes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Privacy">
    Probate is public record. Anyone can see what you owned and who inherited it. Trust transfers remain private.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Incapacity Planning">
    If you become unable to manage affairs, successor trustee can handle property without court-supervised guardianship. Smoother transition than relying on power of attorney alone.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Control Over Distribution">
    Trust terms can specify exactly how and when beneficiaries receive property. Can protect inheritance from creditors, divorce, or irresponsible spending.

    Example: Child inherits at 25, receives half at 30, remainder at 35.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multiple Properties or States">
    Avoids probate in each state where you own property. Without trust, real estate in other states requires separate "ancillary probate" in each location.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Setup Cost">
    Living trusts cost more to establish than simple wills. Attorney fees typically range from \$1,500 to \$5,000+ depending on complexity.

    May not be worth it for modest estates or states with simple probate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ongoing Maintenance">
    New property must be transferred into the trust. Refinancing may require moving property out and back in. Requires attention to keep funded properly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No Asset Protection (Revocable)">
    Revocable living trusts don't protect against creditors, lawsuits, or Medicaid spend-down. Assets still count as yours.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Doesn't Eliminate All Planning">
    Still need pour-over will (catches assets not in trust), healthcare directives, and power of attorney for non-trust matters.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Trusts and Mortgages

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Existing Mortgages">
    Most mortgages have "due on sale" clauses allowing lender to demand full payment if property transfers. However, federal law (Garn-St. Germain Act) generally protects transfers to living trusts where borrower remains beneficiary.

    Notify lender of transfer but acceleration is typically prohibited.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="New Mortgages">
    Some lenders don't lend directly to trusts. May need to purchase in personal name, then transfer to trust after closing. Or transfer out of trust to refinance, then back in.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Title Insurance">
    Title companies can insure property in trusts. May require trust certification showing trustee authority and trust terms. Plan ahead to avoid closing delays.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## After the Grantor Dies

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trust becomes irrevocable">
    Terms lock in. Successor trustee takes over management duties.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trustee gathers documentation">
    Death certificate, trust document, property records, and any amendments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Debts and taxes paid">
    Trustee pays any outstanding obligations from trust assets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Property distributed or managed">
    Trustee transfers property to beneficiaries per trust terms or continues managing if trust requires.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deed recorded">
    New deed transferring from trustee to beneficiary recorded with county. No court involvement required.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Is a Trust Right for You?

**Trusts make sense when:**

- Estate would face lengthy or costly probate
- You own property in multiple states
- Privacy is important
- You want control over how heirs receive property
- Incapacity planning is a priority
- Estate is moderately complex

**Trusts may not be necessary when:**

- Estate is small and state has simplified probate
- All property passes by beneficiary designation or joint ownership
- Cost of trust exceeds probate savings
- Simpler tools accomplish goals

<Note>
  Estate planning isn't one-size-fits-all. Consult an estate planning attorney to evaluate whether a trust fits your situation and goals.
