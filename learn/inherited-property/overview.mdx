## Inheriting Real Estate

Inherited property refers to real estate transferred to a beneficiary after the owner's death, either through a will, [trust](/service-categories/legal/ownership-changes/trusts-and-real-estate), or state intestacy laws. The inheritance process involves legal transfer of ownership, potential tax considerations, and decisions about what to do with the property.

Inheriting real estate differs from purchasing property. The transfer process, tax treatment, and timeline follow different rules than a standard real estate transaction.

## Common Inheritance Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Property left through a will">
    The deceased named specific beneficiaries for the property in their will. The estate goes through [probate court](/service-categories/legal/ownership-changes/probate-process) to validate the will and authorize the transfer. Probate timelines range from several months to over a year depending on estate complexity and state requirements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Property held in a trust">
    The property was transferred to a [trust](/service-categories/legal/ownership-changes/trusts-and-real-estate) before the owner's death. Trust assets typically bypass probate and transfer according to trust instructions. The successor trustee manages the transfer process without court involvement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Joint ownership with survivorship rights">
    The property was owned jointly with [right of survivorship](/service-categories/title-escrow/title-ownership-options). Ownership transfers automatically to the surviving owner upon death. This applies to joint tenancy and tenancy by the entirety arrangements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No will (intestate succession)">
    The deceased did not leave a will. State intestacy laws determine who inherits the property based on family relationships. The estate goes through probate, and the court appoints an administrator to manage the process.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multiple heirs">
    The property passes to more than one beneficiary. All heirs share ownership and must agree on decisions about the property. Disagreements may require negotiation, [buyouts](/service-categories/legal/ownership-changes/buyout-scenarios), or [partition actions](/service-categories/legal/property-issues/property-disputes).
  </Accordion>

## Your Options

Inheriting property presents three primary choices. The right decision depends on financial circumstances, property condition, location, and personal goals.

| Option                | Best When                                                                             | Considerations                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sell the property** | Immediate cash needed, property is distant, multiple heirs want to liquidate          | Capital gains tax on appreciation after inheritance, selling costs, market timing |
| **Keep as residence** | Property fits housing needs, emotional attachment, favorable location                 | Ongoing maintenance, property taxes, insurance, potential renovation costs        |
| **Keep as rental**    | Want ongoing income, property is in good rental market, can manage or hire management | Landlord responsibilities, rental income taxes, property management costs         |

## Typical Timeline

The time from inheritance to final resolution varies significantly based on whether probate is required and what the heirs decide to do with the property.

| Phase                 | Timeframe   | What Happens                                                  |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial steps         | 1-4 weeks   | Secure property, locate documents, notify relevant parties    |
| Probate (if required) | 4-18 months | Court validates will, appoints executor, authorizes transfers |
| Title transfer        | 2-8 weeks   | Prepare and record deed transferring ownership to heirs       |
| Decision and action   | Varies      | Sell, move in, or convert to rental                           |

<Note>
  Properties held in trusts or with survivorship rights skip the probate phase, significantly shortening the timeline.
</Note>

## Common Challenges

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Disagreement among heirs">
    Multiple beneficiaries may have different goals. One heir may want to sell while another wants to keep the property. Resolution options include [buyouts](/service-categories/legal/ownership-changes/buyout-scenarios), mediated agreements, or partition actions through the court.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Property condition issues">
    Inherited properties sometimes have deferred maintenance, outdated systems, or code violations. Heirs must decide whether to invest in repairs before selling or adjust the sale price accordingly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mortgage or liens on property">
    Existing debt does not disappear at death. Heirs inherit the property subject to any mortgages or [liens](/service-categories/legal/property-issues/liens-and-encumbrances). The loan must be paid off, assumed, or refinanced.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Emotional attachment">
    Family homes carry memories that complicate objective decision-making. Separating emotional value from financial reality helps heirs make sound choices.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Out-of-state property">
    Managing inherited property in another state adds complexity. Heirs must handle legal requirements in that state and manage the property remotely or hire local help.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Get an appraisal as soon as possible after inheritance. The fair market value at the date of death establishes the [stepped-up basis](/service-categories/accountants-tax/tax-implications-selling) for tax purposes.
