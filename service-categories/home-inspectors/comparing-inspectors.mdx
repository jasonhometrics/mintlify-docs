Home inspector quality varies significantly. Choosing an experienced, thorough inspector provides valuable information about property condition. Choosing poorly can result in missed defects and costly surprises.

Understanding what differentiates inspectors helps buyers make informed hiring decisions.

## What to Look For

</AccordionGroup>

## Red Flags

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Unusually low price">
    Very cheap inspections may indicate:
    
    - Rushed, superficial inspection
    - Inexperienced inspector
    - Limited scope
    - No insurance coverage
    
    Quality inspections take time. Extremely low prices often mean corners cut.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Won't provide sample report">
    Reluctance to share sample report suggests:
    
    - Report quality is poor
    - Limited documentation
    - Inspector may lack thoroughness
    
    Reputable inspectors are proud of their reports.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Guarantees or predictions">
    Be cautious of inspectors who:
    
    - Guarantee they'll find problems
    - Promise property will have no issues
    - Predict exact remaining life of systems
    - Make claims beyond inspection scope
    
    Inspections are point-in-time assessments with limitations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Offers repairs">
    Inspectors who offer to repair what they find have conflict of interest.
    
    Inspection should be independent assessment. Repairs should be separate.
    
    Some states prohibit inspectors from offering repairs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rushing the inspection">
    Thorough inspection of average home takes 2-3 hours.
    
    Inspectors who complete in under 2 hours may be:
    
    - Skipping areas
    - Not being thorough
    - Using quick checklist approach
    
    Rushing means missing things.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Agent pressure for specific inspector">
    If agent strongly pushes specific inspector:
    
    - Ask why they recommend this person
    - Consider whether inspector might underreport to help deals close
    - Remember you're paying and get to choose
    
    Some agents prefer inspectors who don't "kill deals."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
The cheapest inspector isn't the best value. A thorough inspector who finds issues saves you far more than the inspection costs. Don't choose based on price alone.
</Warning>
