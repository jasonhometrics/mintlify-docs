# How to Evaluate Mortgage Lenders

**You know a proper pre-approval matters. Now you need to find the lender who'll deliver one.**

Most buyers interview one lender (usually whoever their agent recommends) and call it done. That's a mistake. When you're about to borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars, you want options.

**Interview at least three lenders.** Compare their experience, communication style, and approach. The right questions reveal who's actually qualified to guide your transaction.

## What You're Really Evaluating

You're not just comparing interest rates. You're choosing:

**Experience** - Someone who's closed 180 loans vs 12 knows what problems look like before they blow up your deal.

**Communication** - Real estate happens on weekends. You need someone who answers their phone when seconds matter.

**Local knowledge** - Relationships with agents, title companies, and appraisers prevent delays and strengthen your offers.

**Problem-solving** - When issues arise (and they will), you want someone who's seen it before and knows how to fix it.

## Essential Questions to Ask

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Experience & Track Record">
    **"How many loans do you close per month, and how long have you been lending in this market?"**
    
    You want someone doing at least 5-10 loans monthly. Less than that means limited exposure to complex scenarios.
    
    **Follow-up:** "What's your on-time closing rate?"
    
    Delays cost money. A lender with 95%+ on-time closings has their process dialed in.
    
    **"Can you share an example of a difficult deal you closed recently?"**
    
    Their answer reveals problem-solving ability. If they can't think of one, they either haven't done many deals or aren't being honest.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communication & Availability">
    **"Who will be my main point of contact, and how quickly do you typically respond?"**
    
    Some lenders hand you off to a processor. Others stay involved the entire time. Know who you're actually working with.
    
    **"Are you available evenings and weekends?"**
    
    Offer deadlines don't respect business hours. If your lender clocks out Friday at 5pm and you need updated pre-approval numbers by Sunday morning, you're stuck.
    
    **"How do you keep clients updated throughout the process?"**
    
    Weekly check-ins? Only when you reach out? You want proactive communication, not radio silence until problems surface.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Local Market Knowledge">
    **"How many deals have you closed in [your target area] in the past year?"**
    
    Local lenders know property values, appraisal timelines, and county-specific requirements. National lenders can be great too, but local experience matters when things get complicated.
    
    **"Do you have relationships with local real estate agents and title companies?"**
    
    When your lender calls the listing agent to verify financing strength, that relationship carries weight. It can tip competitive offers in your favor.
    
    **"Are you familiar with first-time buyer programs or down payment assistance in this area?"**
    
    Local grants and programs can save you thousands. Lenders embedded in your market know what's available.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fee Transparency">
    **"Can you break down all your fees for me upfront?"**
    
    Look for:
    - Origination fee (typically 0.5-1% of loan amount)
    - Processing fee
    - Underwriting fee
    - Application fee
    - Any other charges
    
    **"What fees are negotiable?"**
    
    Some lenders reduce or waive fees to win your business. Others won't budge. Knowing what's negotiable gives you leverage.
    
    **"Will you provide a Loan Estimate within 3 days of my application?"**
    
    This is required by law, but it's worth confirming. The Loan Estimate shows all costs in writing so you can compare lenders accurately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pre-Approval Process">
    **"What documentation do you need for a real pre-approval?"**
    
    If they don't ask for W2s, tax returns, pay stubs, and bank statements upfront, it's not a real pre-approval.
    
    **"How long does your pre-approval process take?"**
    
    1-3 business days is standard with proper documentation. Anything faster probably isn't thorough.
    
    **"Do you do a soft or hard credit pull?"**
    
    Pre-approvals require a hard pull. Multiple hard pulls within 45 days for mortgage shopping count as one inquiry, so don't worry about shopping around.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Problem-Solving & Flexibility">
    **"What happens if the appraisal comes in low?"**
    
    Good lenders have strategies: dispute the appraisal, find comparable sales data, explore alternative financing, or help you negotiate with the seller.
    
    **"What loan programs do you offer, and how do you help me choose?"**
    
    One-size-fits-all advice is a red flag. They should ask about your down payment, how long you plan to stay, and your financial goals before recommending a loan type.
    
    **"Have you ever had a deal fall through? What happened?"**
    
    Honest lenders will tell you about deals that didn't close and what they learned. If they claim 100% success with zero problems, they're either lying or inexperienced.

## Red Flags vs Green Flags

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Red Flags" icon="triangle-exclamation">

    - Vague answers about their process or experience
    - Pressures you to apply immediately
    - Poor communication during your initial contact
    - Can't provide recent client references
    - Unavailable outside business hours
    - Doesn't ask about your financial goals or timeline
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Green Flags" icon="circle-check">
    **Look for these signs:**

    - Explains pre-approval process and timeline clearly
    - Provides specific examples of recent deals
    - Offers to connect you with past clients
    - Responsive communication within hours, not days

## Comparing Multiple Lenders

**Don't just pick the first one who answers the phone.** Use this framework:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Schedule calls with 3 lenders">
    Get referrals from your agent, research local options, and check reviews. Schedule 30-minute calls with each.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask the same questions to all three">
    Use the questions above. Take notes. Compare their answers side-by-side.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Loan Estimates for the same scenario">
    Give each lender identical information (loan amount, down payment, credit score estimate). Compare their rates and fees directly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check reviews and references">
    Read Google reviews. Ask for 2-3 recent client references. Call them and ask about communication, closing experience, and any surprises.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trust your gut on communication">
    You'll be working with this person for 30-45 days during a stressful process. If they're unresponsive or hard to reach now, it won't improve later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Good Communication Looks Like

**During pre-approval:**
- Responds to your initial inquiry within 24 hours
- Asks detailed questions before giving you a number
- Explains what documents they need and why
- Provides clear timeline for pre-approval letter

**Once you're under contract:**
- Sends regular updates (weekly at minimum)
- Flags potential issues before they become crises
- Answers questions within a few hours during business days
- Available by phone on weekends for urgent matters

**At closing:**
- Coordinates with title company to prevent delays
- Explains your Closing Disclosure line by line
- Confirms wire instructions securely
- Follows up after closing to ensure everything's resolved

<Tip>
**Test their responsiveness during your initial inquiry.** If it takes 3 days to get a call back when they're trying to win your business, imagine how slow they'll be when you're already locked in.
</Tip>

## Local vs National Lenders

**Local lenders** often bring:
- Relationships with agents and title companies
- Understanding of local programs and grants
- Faster response to market-specific issues
- Reputation matters (can't afford to blow deals)

**National lenders** can offer:
- Competitive rates due to volume
- Advanced technology platforms
- Broader loan program options
- Consistent processes across markets

<Note>
**Neither is automatically better.** What matters is the individual loan officer's experience, communication, and track record. A great national lender beats a mediocre local one, and vice versa.
</Note>

## The Interview Mindset

**You're not bothering them by asking questions.** You're interviewing them for a job that involves hundreds of thousands of dollars and one of the biggest decisions of your life.

Lenders who get defensive or annoyed by your questions aren't worth working with. The best lenders welcome your due diligence because they know it leads to better outcomes.

**Ask hard questions. Compare your options. Choose the lender who earns your trust through experience, transparency, and communication.**
