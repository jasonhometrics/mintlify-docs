description: "Capital gains, exclusions, and timing strategies"
---

Selling a home can trigger capital gains taxes on the profit. However, significant exclusions exist for primary residences that allow many sellers to pay little or no tax on their gains.

Understanding the rules before listing helps sellers make timing decisions and maximize tax benefits.

## How Capital Gains Work

Capital gain is the difference between what you sell for and your adjusted basis.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Calculating gain">
    **Sale price**

    - Minus selling costs (commissions, closing costs) = Net sale proceeds

    **Net sale proceeds**

    - Minus adjusted basis = Capital gain (or loss)

    > **Example:**
    >
    > - Sale price: \$500,000
    > - Selling costs: \$35,000
    > - Net proceeds: \$465,000
    > - Adjusted basis: \$320,000
    > - Capital gain: \$145,000
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Adjusted basis">
    Original cost basis plus improvements minus depreciation.

    **Increases to basis:**

    - Original purchase price
    - Qualifying closing costs from purchase
    - Capital improvements (additions, renovations, major systems)

    **Decreases to basis:**

    - Depreciation taken (rental or home office)
    - Casualty loss deductions
    - Insurance proceeds for damage not used for repairs
    - Energy credits received
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Capital improvements vs repairs">
    **Capital improvements (add to basis):**

    - Room additions
    - New roof
    - HVAC replacement
    - Kitchen remodel
    - New windows
    - Finished basement
    - Landscaping (permanent)

    **Repairs (not added to basis):**

    - Painting
    - Fixing leaks
    - Patching drywall
    - Replacing broken fixtures
    - General maintenance

    Improvements add value or extend useful life. Repairs maintain current condition.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Keep receipts for all improvements. You may sell decades after making improvements, and documentation increases your basis, reducing taxable gain.
</Note>

## Primary Residence Exclusion

The most valuable tax benefit for homeowners. Allows excluding significant gains from taxation.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Exclusion amounts">
    - Single filers: Up to \$250,000 excluded
    - Married filing jointly: Up to \$500,000 excluded

    Gains within these limits are completely tax-free. No tax owed, no reporting required (in most cases).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ownership and use tests">
    To qualify for full exclusion, must meet both tests during the 5-year period ending on sale date:

    **Ownership test:** Owned the home for at least 2 years (730 days).

    **Use test:** Lived in the home as primary residence for at least 2 years (730 days).

    The 2 years don't need to be continuous. Total of 24 months within 5-year period qualifies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Married couples">
    To claim full \$500,000 exclusion:

    - File joint return
    - At least one spouse meets ownership test
    - Both spouses meet use test
    - Neither spouse used exclusion in prior 2 years

    If only one spouse meets requirements, that spouse can still claim \$250,000 exclusion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Frequency limitation">
    Can only use exclusion once every 2 years. If you sold another home and claimed exclusion within past 2 years, you cannot claim again.

    Exception: Partial exclusion may be available if sale due to unforeseen circumstances.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Partial Exclusion

If you don't meet full ownership and use requirements, you may still qualify for partial exclusion.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Qualifying reasons">
    Partial exclusion available if sale is due to:

    **Work-related move:**

    - New job location at least 50 miles farther from home
    - Employer transfer
    - New employment

    **Health reasons:**

    - Doctor-recommended move
    - Caring for family member
    - Illness requiring move

    **Unforeseen circumstances:**

    - Death
    - Divorce
    - Job loss
    - Multiple births from same pregnancy
    - Disaster damage
    - Other events determined by IRS
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Calculating partial exclusion">
    Multiply full exclusion by fraction of 2-year requirement met.

    **Example:**

    - Lived in home 18 months (1.5 years)
    - Relocated for job
    - Single filer
    - Partial exclusion: \$250,000 x (1.5/2) = \$187,500
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Capital Gains Tax Rates

Gains exceeding exclusion are taxed based on how long you owned the property.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Long-term vs short-term">
    **Long-term (owned more than 1 year):**

    - 0% if taxable income under \$47,025 (single) or \$94,050 (married)
    - 15% for most taxpayers
    - 20% for highest earners

    **Short-term (owned 1 year or less):**

    - Taxed as ordinary income
    - Rates from 10% to 37% depending on bracket

    Long-term rates are significantly lower for most sellers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Net Investment Income Tax">
    Additional 3.8% tax on investment income (including capital gains) for higher earners.

    Applies when modified adjusted gross income exceeds:

    - \$200,000 (single)
    - \$250,000 (married filing jointly)

    Can push effective rate to 23.8% for high-income sellers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="State taxes">
    Most states also tax capital gains. Rates vary from 0% to over 13%.

    Combined federal and state rates can exceed 30% in high-tax states.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Depreciation Recapture

If you claimed depreciation on the property, some gain is taxed at higher rates.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When it applies">
    - Rental property (depreciation required)
    - Home office deduction (depreciation claimed)
    - Portion of home used for business

    Primary residences with no business use have no depreciation to recapture.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Recapture rate">
    Depreciation recapture taxed at 25%, regardless of your regular capital gains rate.

    This is higher than the 15% long-term rate most taxpayers pay.

    Recapture is calculated first, then remaining gain taxed at regular capital gains rates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Example">
    - Sold rental property with \$100,000 total gain
    - Claimed \$40,000 in depreciation over ownership
    - Depreciation recapture: \$40,000 taxed at 25% = \$10,000
    - Remaining gain: \$60,000 taxed at 15% = \$9,000
    - Total tax: \$19,000
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Depreciation must be recaptured even if you didn't actually claim it. If you should have depreciated rental property but didn't, IRS calculates recapture as if you had.
</Warning>

## Timing Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Meeting the 2-year requirement">
    If close to meeting ownership or use test, waiting to sell can save significant taxes.

    **Example:** Owned 22 months, planning to sell. Waiting 2 more months qualifies for \$250,000 exclusion.

    At 15% capital gains rate, waiting could save \$37,500 in taxes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Year-end timing">
    Gain is taxed in year sale closes. If income varies year to year, timing closing can affect tax rate.

    **Higher income year:** Consider delaying closing to January. **Lower income year:** Consider closing before December 31.

    Coordinate with buyer and consider market risks of delay.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Converting rental to primary">
    Want to use primary residence exclusion on former rental? Must live in property as primary residence for 2 of last 5 years.

    **Limitation:** Gain allocated to periods of non-qualified use (after 2008) is not excludable.

    Plan conversion well in advance of sale.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Installment sales">
    Spreading payments over multiple years can spread tax liability. Gain recognized as payments received.

    Useful when large gain would push into higher bracket. Interest must be charged on deferred payments.

    Complex rules apply. Consult tax professional.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Selling Costs That Reduce Gain

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Deductible from sale price">
    - Real estate agent commissions
    - Advertising costs
    - Legal fees
    - Title insurance (seller's share)
    - Transfer taxes
    - Recording fees
    - Escrow fees
    - Home warranty (if seller pays)
    - Staging costs
    - Repairs required by contract
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not deductible">
    - Moving expenses
    - Mortgage payoff (doesn't affect gain calculation)
    - Prepayment penalties (may be deductible elsewhere)
    - Property taxes (deductible separately if itemizing)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Special Situations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Inherited property">
    Basis "steps up" to fair market value at date of death. Gain is only appreciation after inheritance.

    > **Example:** Parent bought for \$100,000. Worth \$400,000 at death. Your basis is \$400,000. Sell for \$420,000. Gain is only \$20,000.

    Primary residence exclusion doesn't apply unless you live there for 2 years.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Divorce">
    Transfers between spouses incident to divorce are not taxable. Receiving spouse takes over original basis.

    Future sale by receiving spouse may trigger gain based on original purchase price.

    Consider tax implications when negotiating property division.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Selling at a loss">
    Losses on personal residence are not deductible. You cannot claim capital loss on home you lived in.

    Losses on investment property (rental, flip) may be deductible, subject to limitations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Partial rental use">
    If part of home was rented, gain must be allocated between residential and rental portions.

    Primary residence exclusion applies only to residential portion. Rental portion subject to depreciation recapture and capital gains.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Like-kind exchange history">
    If you acquired property through 1031 exchange, original basis carries forward. Exclusion doesn't apply for 5 years after exchange.

    Gain includes deferred gain from exchanged property.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reporting Requirements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When reporting isn't required">
    No Form 1099-S or Schedule D needed if:

    - Gain is within exclusion limits
    - Ownership and use tests fully met
    - Exclusion wasn't used in prior 2 years
    - Property was primary residence only

    Seller certifies eligibility at closing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When reporting is required">
    Must report sale on Schedule D if:

    - Gain exceeds exclusion
    - Exclusion requirements not fully met
    - Any portion was rental or business use
    - Received Form 1099-S
    - Partial exclusion claimed

    Keep records even if not required to report. IRS may question later.
