---

Setting up a Google Business Profile involves either claiming an existing listing or creating a new one, then verifying ownership. Verification proves to Google that the business is legitimate and that the person managing the profile has authority to do so.

The process differs depending on whether a listing already exists for the business.

## Check for Existing Listings

Before creating a new profile, search for existing listings that may need to be claimed instead:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search Google Maps">
    Open Google Maps and search for the business name. If a listing appears, it may need to be claimed rather than created new.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search Google">
    Search the business name on Google. Look for a knowledge panel on the right side of results that indicates an existing GBP.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check for duplicates">
    Search variations of the business name and the address. Multiple listings for the same business should be consolidated.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Creating a new listing when one already exists creates a duplicate. Duplicates split reviews and confuse search algorithms. Always claim existing listings rather than creating new ones.
</Warning>

## Claiming an Existing Listing

If a listing exists but is not managed by the business:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the listing">
    Search for the business on Google Maps or Google Search.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select 'Claim this business'">
    Click on the listing, then find the "Claim this business" or "Own this business?" link.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in to Google">
    Use a Google account associated with the business. Business email domains (name@company.com) are preferable to personal accounts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete verification">
    Follow the verification process described below.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### If Already Claimed by Someone Else

The listing may show as already managed. Options include:

- **Request access**: Google provides a form to request access from the current manager
- **Contact the manager**: If known, reach out directly
- **Appeal**: If the claim is illegitimate, dispute it through Google's support process

<Info>
Former employees, marketing agencies, or previous owners sometimes retain access to listings. Recovery can take days to weeks depending on the situation.
</Info>

## Creating a New Listing

If no listing exists:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Google Business Profile">
    Visit business.google.com or search "Google Business Profile" and click "Manage now."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter business name">
    Type the exact business name as it should appear publicly. Do not add keywords or locations unless they are part of the legal business name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select business category">
    Choose the primary category that best describes what the business does. This can be refined later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add location or service area">
    For storefronts: Enter the physical address.
    For service-area businesses: Indicate that you serve customers at their location and define service areas.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter contact information">
    Add phone number and website URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete verification">
    Follow the verification process described below.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification Methods

Google offers several verification methods depending on the business type and situation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Postcard Verification">
    Google mails a postcard with a verification code to the business address. Typical delivery takes 5-14 days.
    
    **Requirements**: Must have access to mail at the listed address.
    
    **Process**: Enter the code from the postcard in the GBP dashboard.
    
    **Notes**: Most common method. If the postcard does not arrive within 14 days, request a new one.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Phone Verification">
    Google calls or texts the business phone number with a verification code.
    
    **Requirements**: Listed phone number must be answered by someone at the business.
    
    **Process**: Receive call or text, enter the code immediately.
    
    **Notes**: Not available for all businesses. Instant verification when available.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Email Verification">
    Google sends a verification code to an email address associated with the business.
    
    **Requirements**: Email must be on the business domain (name@company.com).
    
    **Process**: Click verification link or enter code from email.
    
    **Notes**: Usually available when the website domain matches the email domain.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Video Verification">
    Record a video showing the business location, signage, and operations.
    
    **Requirements**: Must show proof of location and business activity.
    
    **Process**: Upload video through the GBP dashboard. Google reviews within a few days.
    
    **Notes**: Newer option, increasingly common for service-area businesses.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Instant Verification">
    Automatic verification for businesses that have already verified their website with Google Search Console.
    
    **Requirements**: Verified Search Console ownership with matching domain.
    
    **Process**: Verification happens immediately during setup.
    
    **Notes**: Fastest method when available.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
If phone or email verification is available, use it for fastest access. Postcard delays can mean waiting weeks to update an inaccurate listing.

## Business Types

GBP handles different business types with specific configurations:

### Storefront Businesses

Businesses where customers visit a physical location:

- Enter the full street address
- Address appears publicly in search results
- Enable location on Maps

### Service-Area Businesses

Businesses that travel to customer locations:

- Do not display a street address publicly
- Define service areas by city, zip code, or region
- Still require a real address for verification (not displayed)

### Hybrid Businesses

Businesses that both receive customers and travel to them:

- Display the address publicly
- Also define service areas
- Common for businesses with office locations plus mobile services

<Warning>
Service-area businesses cannot hide their address if they also want to show it in search results. Choose the model that matches how customers actually engage with the business.
</Warning>
