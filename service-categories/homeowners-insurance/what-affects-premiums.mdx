Homeowners insurance premiums vary significantly based on property characteristics, owner factors, and coverage choices. Understanding what drives costs helps homeowners make informed decisions and identify opportunities for savings.

Some factors are within your control. Others are fixed characteristics of your property or location.

## Property Factors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Location">
    Where your home is located significantly impacts premiums.

    **Higher premiums:**

    - Coastal areas (hurricane, flood risk)
    - Tornado-prone regions
    - Wildfire zones
    - High-crime neighborhoods
    - Areas with expensive construction costs
    - Distance from fire station or hydrant

    **Lower premiums:**

    - Low natural disaster risk
    - Low crime areas
    - Close to fire department
    - Fire hydrant within 1,000 feet

    Location cannot be changed, but understanding risk factors helps explain premium differences.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Age of home">
    Older homes typically cost more to insure.

    **Why older homes cost more:**

    - Outdated electrical, plumbing, or heating systems
    - Higher likelihood of claims
    - More expensive repairs due to materials or construction
    - May not meet current building codes

    Updating major systems (electrical, plumbing, HVAC, roof) can reduce premiums on older homes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Construction type">
    Building materials affect both fire risk and repair costs.

    **Lower premiums:**

    - Brick or stone exterior
    - Fire-resistant roofing (metal, tile, slate)
    - Concrete block construction

    **Higher premiums:**

    - Wood frame construction
    - Wood shake or shingle roof
    - Older materials
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Roof condition and age">
    Roof is one of the most important premium factors.

    **Lower premiums:**

    - New roof (under 10 years)
    - Impact-resistant shingles
    - Metal or tile roofing
    - Good condition documented by inspection

    **Higher premiums:**

    - Roof over 15-20 years old
    - Wood shake shingles
    - Visible wear or damage
    - Prior roof claims

    New roof can reduce premiums 10-20% or more.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Square footage and replacement cost">
    Larger homes and higher replacement costs mean higher premiums.

    More square footage means more to rebuild. Higher quality finishes cost more to replace.

    Premium is roughly proportional to dwelling coverage amount.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Swimming pool">
    Pools increase liability risk and premiums.

    **Premium increase:** 5-10% or more

    **Mitigation:**

    - Fencing with self-latching gate
    - Pool cover
    - Alarm system
    - Diving board removal (highest risk)

    Some insurers exclude pool coverage or decline to insure homes with certain pool features.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Trampoline">
    Trampolines significantly increase injury risk.

    Some insurers:

    - Charge higher premiums
    - Exclude trampoline injuries from coverage
    - Decline to insure homes with trampolines

    Disclose trampolines when applying. Non-disclosure can void coverage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Dog breed">
    Certain breeds are associated with higher bite claims.

    **Commonly restricted breeds:**

    - Pit bulls and Staffordshire terriers
    - Rottweilers
    - German Shepherds
    - Doberman Pinschers
    - Chows
    - Akitas
    - Wolf hybrids

    Some insurers charge more, exclude coverage for dog bites, or decline to insure. Others don't consider breed at all.

    Policies vary significantly. Shop around if you have a restricted breed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Owner Factors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Claims history">
    Prior claims are strong predictors of future claims.

    **Impact:**

    - Recent claims (3-5 years) increase premiums
    - Multiple claims have compounding effect
    - Even claims at previous addresses count
    - Water damage and liability claims weigh heavily

    Claims remain on your record (CLUE report) for 5-7 years.

    Filing small claims may cost more in premium increases than the claim payout. Consider paying small losses out of pocket.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credit-based insurance score">
    Most states allow insurers to use credit information in pricing.

    **What's considered:**

    - Payment history
    - Outstanding debt
    - Length of credit history
    - New credit inquiries
    - Credit utilization

    **Not the same as credit score.** Insurance scores weight factors differently than lending scores.

    **Impact:** Can affect premiums by 20-50% or more.

    **States that prohibit or limit use:** California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Michigan (varies by state).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prior insurance history">
    Continuous coverage is viewed favorably.

    **Higher premiums or difficulty getting coverage:**

    - Gaps in insurance history
    - Prior policy cancellations
    - Non-renewals by previous insurer

    Maintain continuous coverage even if switching carriers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Occupancy">
    Who lives in the home affects risk.

    **Owner-occupied:** Lowest premiums. Owners maintain property better and are present to prevent losses.

    **Rental property:** Higher premiums. Requires landlord policy (not standard homeowners).

    **Vacant:** Much higher premiums or specialty coverage required. Empty homes have higher risk of undetected damage, vandalism, and theft.

## Coverage Choices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Deductible amount">
    Higher deductible means lower premium, but more out-of-pocket per claim.

    **Typical options:**

    | Deductible | Premium Impact  |
    | ---------- | --------------- |
    | \$500      | Highest premium |
    | \$1,000    | 10-15% savings  |
    | \$2,500    | 20-30% savings  |
    | \$5,000    | 30-40% savings  |

    Choose deductible you can afford to pay if claim occurs. Don't select high deductible just for savings if you can't cover it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Coverage limits">
    Higher limits cost more.

    **Dwelling coverage:** Should match rebuilding cost. Don't underinsure to save premium.

    **Personal property:** Default is percentage of dwelling. May need adjustment based on actual belongings.

    **Liability:** Increasing from \$100,000 - \$300,000 is relatively inexpensive. Higher limits recommended for most homeowners.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Replacement cost vs ACV">
    Replacement cost coverage costs more but pays significantly more at claim time.

    **Premium difference:** 10-15% more for replacement cost

    **Claim difference:** Can be 40-60% more payout

    Replacement cost is worth the premium for most homeowners.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Endorsements and riders">
    Additional coverage options increase premiums.

    **Common endorsements:**

    - Scheduled personal property (jewelry, art)
    - Water backup coverage
    - Equipment breakdown
    - Identity theft protection
    - Home business coverage
    - Ordinance or law coverage

    Add endorsements based on actual needs.

</Warning>

## Ways to Lower Premiums

<AccordionGroup>

    Shop every 2-3 years even if satisfied. Rates change and new options emerge.
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What Doesn't Lower Premiums

<AccordionGroup>

    Land value affects market price but not insurance.
  </Accordion>

    Premium stays the same after mortgage payoff. Risk to insurer is unchanged.

    You may no longer need to escrow, giving more control over payments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Minor cosmetic updates">
    New paint, landscaping, or decor don't affect premiums. Only functional improvements (roof, systems) matter.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
