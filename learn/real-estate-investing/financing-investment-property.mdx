## How to Finance Investment Property

Investment property financing differs from primary residence mortgages. [Lenders](/service-categories/mortgage-lenders/overview) view investment properties as higher risk, resulting in stricter requirements, larger down payments, and higher interest rates.

Understanding financing options helps investors choose the right loan product and prepare for lender requirements.

## How Investment Loans Differ

| Factor                      | Primary Residence | Investment Property    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Down payment                | 3-20%             | 15-25% typical         |
| Interest rate               | Lower             | 0.5-0.875% higher      |
| Credit score minimum        | 620+              | 680-720+ preferred     |
| Cash reserves required      | 2 months          | 6+ months              |
| Debt-to-income scrutiny     | Standard          | Stricter               |
| Rental income consideration | N/A               | Partial credit allowed |

<Note>
  Owner-occupied multifamily properties (2-4 units where owner lives in one) may qualify for primary residence financing with lower down payments.
</Note>

## Down Payment Requirements

Down payment varies by loan type and number of units.

| Property Type | Conventional         | DSCR   | Portfolio |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Single-family | 15-20%               | 20-25% | Varies    |
| 2-4 units     | 20-25%               | 20-25% | Varies    |
| 5+ units      | Commercial financing | 25-30% | Varies    |

<Note>
  House hacking (owner-occupied 2-4 unit) may allow down payments as low as 3.5% with [FHA](/service-categories/mortgage-lenders/loan-types) or 5% with conventional loans.
</Note>

**Where down payments come from:**

- Savings
- Home equity from existing properties
- Retirement account loans (401k loans, though not withdrawals)
- Cash-out refinance of other properties
- Gift funds (restrictions apply; check with lender)
- Partnership capital

## Interest Rates

Investment property rates run higher than primary residence rates due to increased risk.

**Factors affecting your rate:**

- Credit score (higher score = lower rate)
- Down payment amount (larger down payment = lower rate)
- Loan type (conventional typically lowest)
- Property type (single-family lower than multifamily)
- Loan term (15-year lower than 30-year)
- Number of existing financed properties

<Warning>
  Rate quotes for primary residences do not apply to investment properties. Always specify investment property when shopping rates.
</Warning>

## Qualifying with Rental Income

Lenders may count expected rental income to help borrowers qualify, offsetting the new mortgage payment.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How rental income is counted">
    Conventional lenders typically count 75% of expected rental income. The 25% reduction accounts for vacancy and expenses.

    **Example:**

    - Expected rent: \$2,000/month
    - Income counted: \$1,500/month (75%)
    - New mortgage payment: \$1,800/month
    - Net impact on DTI: +\$300/month expense
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Documentation required">
    - Signed [lease agreement](/service-categories/legal/rentals/lease-agreements) (if property is already rented)
    - [Appraiser's](/service-categories/appraisers/overview) rent schedule (comparable rent analysis)
    - Tax returns showing rental income (for existing landlords)
    - Schedule E from prior year returns
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DSCR qualification">
    DSCR loans focus entirely on property income. The debt service coverage ratio compares rental income to mortgage payment.

    **Example:**

    - Monthly rent: \$2,000
    - Monthly mortgage (PITI): \$1,600
    - DSCR: 1.25 (\$2,000 ÷ \$1,600)

    Most DSCR lenders require 1.0-1.25 minimum.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reserve Requirements

Lenders require cash reserves to ensure borrowers can cover payments if rental income stops.

**Typical requirements:**

- 6 months PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance) for new investment property
- Additional reserves for each existing financed property
- Reserves must be documented and sourced

**Acceptable reserve sources:**

- Checking and savings accounts
- Investment accounts (stocks, bonds, mutual funds)
- Retirement accounts (counted at 60-70% of value)
- Cash value of life insurance

## Financing Multiple Properties

Investors building portfolios face additional considerations.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Conventional loan limits">
    Fannie Mae allows up to 10 financed properties per borrower. Requirements tighten after 4 properties:

    - 25% down payment required
    - 720+ credit score
    - 6 months reserves per property
    - No late mortgage payments in past year
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Beyond 10 properties">
    Options for investors exceeding conventional limits:

    - DSCR loans (no property count limits)
    - Portfolio lenders
    - Commercial loans
    - Blanket loans covering multiple properties
    - Paying off existing loans to stay under limit
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Entity financing">
    Loans to [LLCs or corporations](/service-categories/legal/property-issues/llcs-and-business-structures) rather than individuals. More common for commercial properties and larger portfolios.

    - Higher rates than individual loans
    - Personal guarantee often still required
    - Some lenders specialize in entity lending
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Not all lenders offer investment property loans, and experience levels vary.

**Questions to ask:**

- Do you offer investment property loans?
- What is the minimum down payment?
- What are current rates for investment properties?
- Do you offer DSCR or portfolio loans?
- How many financed properties can I have?
- What reserves are required?
