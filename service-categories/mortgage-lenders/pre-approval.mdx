title: "Pre-Approval"
description: "The verification process that protects earnest money and strengthens offers"
---

Pre-approval is a lender's written commitment to provide financing up to a specified amount, based on verified documentation of income, assets, credit, and debt.

This verification distinguishes pre-approval from pre-qualification and determines whether financing will actually come through once a property is under contract.

## Pre-Approval vs Pre-Qualification

These terms are often used interchangeably but represent very different levels of verification.

Pre-qualification is a conversation. Pre-approval is verification.

## Why Pre-Approval Matters

**Protects earnest money**
Once a purchase contract is signed, earnest money deposits (typically 1-3% of purchase price) are due within days. If financing falls through due to issues that should have been caught earlier, deposits may be at risk.

Proper pre-approval identifies problems before contracts are signed, not after earnest money is deposited.

**Strengthens offers**
Sellers and listing agents recognize the difference between pre-qualification letters and verified pre-approvals. In competitive situations, strong pre-approval signals that financing is likely to close.

**Sets realistic expectations**
Verified pre-approval reveals actual purchasing power, not estimates. This prevents wasted time viewing properties outside actual price range.

**Speeds the process**
Much of the documentation work happens upfront during pre-approval. Once under contract, processing moves faster because verification is already complete.

## Documentation Required

Pre-approval requires documentation proving income, assets, and financial history.

## The Pre-Approval Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial consultation">
    Loan officer reviews financial situation, discusses goals, and explains documentation requirements.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Documentation submission">
    Borrower provides required documents. Loan officer reviews for completeness.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Credit review">
    Lender pulls credit report and reviews credit history. This is a hard inquiry that appears on credit reports.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Income and asset verification">
    Loan officer verifies documentation, calculates qualifying income, and confirms available assets.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Debt-to-income analysis">
    Lender calculates debt-to-income ratio to determine maximum loan amount that meets program requirements.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pre-approval letter issued">
    Written commitment specifying maximum loan amount, subject to property appraisal and final underwriting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Timeline:** 1-3 business days with complete documentation. Delays occur when documents are missing or require clarification.

## What Pre-Approval Letters Include

A pre-approval letter typically states:

- Maximum loan amount approved
- Loan program (conventional, FHA, VA, etc.)
- Interest rate range (may or may not be locked)
- Expiration date (typically 60-90 days)
- Conditions (subject to appraisal, title, etc.)

Letters can be customized for specific properties with exact purchase price and loan amount when making offers.

## Common Issues Discovered During Pre-Approval

Pre-approval catches problems before they derail transactions:

**Income calculation differences**
Bonus, commission, and overtime income may not qualify the way borrowers expect. Lenders often average variable income over two years.

**Debt-to-income ratio limits**
Monthly debt payments relative to income may limit borrowing power below expectations.

**Credit issues**
Late payments, collections, or errors on credit reports may need resolution before approval.

**Asset sourcing**
Large deposits require explanation and documentation. Gift funds require specific paperwork.

**Employment gaps**
Recent job changes or gaps may require explanation or additional documentation.

Discovering these issues during pre-approval allows time for resolution. Discovering them after signing a contract creates deadline pressure and risk.

## Pre-Approval Expiration and Updates

Pre-approval letters expire, typically after 60-90 days. Credit reports, income, and financial situations change over time.

**When updates are needed:**
- Letter expires before contract is signed
- Job or income changes occur
- New debts are taken on
- Large purchases are made
- Offer price exceeds original pre-approval amount

Updating pre-approval requires current documentation and may involve new credit pulls. Notify loan officers of any financial changes during the home search.

<Warning>
**Avoid major financial changes after pre-approval:**

- Don't open new credit cards or loans
- Don't make large purchases (cars, furniture, appliances)
- Don't change jobs without consulting your loan officer
- Don't move money between accounts without documentation

These changes can affect qualification and delay or prevent closing.
