title: "Earning Performance Badges"
description: "How performance badges are earned through consistent, compliant behavior"
---

Performance badges are trust signals that help customers quickly understand a business's track record. They're earned automatically based on observed patterns in reputation and activity, not applied manually, requested, or purchased. Badges reflect consistency over time rather than one-time spikes.

---

## Why Badges Matter

Badges influence customer decisions by reducing uncertainty. When customers compare similar businesses, badges provide quick visual confirmation of sustained quality. Profiles with badges convert at higher rates because they signal proven reliability without requiring customers to read through dozens of reviews.

Badges also improve visibility. Businesses with badges appear more prominently in search results and attract more profile views. This creates a reinforcing cycle: better service leads to consistent reviews, which earn badges, which drive more visibility and customer engagement.

## What Influences Badge Eligibility

Exact thresholds aren't published, but badge eligibility is influenced by several observable factors.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review quality">
    Consistently strong customer feedback matters more than isolated highs or lows. A single negative review doesn't disqualify a business. Repeated patterns do.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review consistency">
    Steady review activity over time is more meaningful than short bursts. Consistent monthly reviews signal reliability, while large spikes followed by long gaps signal inconsistency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review authenticity">
    Hometrics monitors for unnatural or non-compliant review patterns. Examples include purchased reviews, reviews from employees or owners, repeated identical language, and sudden volume spikes without ongoing activity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Time and stability">
    Badges are designed to reward businesses that perform well over time. Longevity and stability matter.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Badges are assigned automatically when these signals align. If a badge hasn't appeared yet, it's usually due to gaps in one or more of these areas.

The most common issue is inconsistency. Businesses that request reviews manually often experience gaps during busy periods, creating irregular patterns that delay badge eligibility.

**Maintaining consistent review activity** is the most reliable path to badge eligibility. Learn how automated systems solve the consistency problem and maintain the review momentum needed for badges.
