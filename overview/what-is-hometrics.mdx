## Real Reviews You Can Trust

### How Reviews Work

All reviews come from Google Business Profiles. We don't host our own reviews. We pull them directly from Google's verified system.

This means:
- Reviews can't be selectively hidden
- Negative feedback appears alongside positive
- Google monitors for fake reviews
- Review dates and content stay authentic

Some profiles display [badges](/overview/badges) indicating consistent performance patterns like high ratings, review volume, or fast response times. These are assigned automatically based on actual review data, not paid placements.

### What You'll See on Each Profile

Every profile shows publicly available information from Google Business Profiles:

- Business name and location
- Google review rating and total count
- Individual customer reviews
- Business hours and contact methods
- Service descriptions
- Performance badges (when earned)

## Message Without Sharing Contact Info

### How Messaging Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send your question">
    Contact professionals directly through our platform. No need to share your email or phone number yet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get responses">
    Professionals reply through the platform. Your conversations stay private until you decide to share contact details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share details when ready">
    Once you're comfortable, provide your phone number or email to schedule consultations or move forward.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
This prevents the flood of sales calls and emails that usually follow traditional contact forms.
</Note>

### Talk to Multiple Professionals at Once

You can message several providers simultaneously. Compare their responses, ask follow-up questions, and get a feel for their communication style, all before sharing any personal information.

This supports the **Rule of Three**: interviewing at least three options in each service category gives you comparison data and helps you spot patterns in pricing, approach, and professionalism.
