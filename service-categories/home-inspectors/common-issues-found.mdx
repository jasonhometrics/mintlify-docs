Home inspections routinely identify certain categories of defects. Understanding common issues helps buyers know what to expect and how to evaluate inspection findings.

Some issues are minor maintenance items while others are significant defects affecting safety, function, or value.

<Note>
  Repair costs vary dramatically by location, contractor, severity, and access. The estimates provided are rough national ranges to help prioritize issues, not quotes. Always get multiple contractor estimates for actual repair costs in your area.

## What Buyers Should Know

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Every home has issues">
    Inspections always find something. The question is whether issues are:

    - Acceptable for age and price of home
    - Safety concerns requiring attention
    - Deal-breakers warranting termination
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Age-appropriate expectations">
    Older homes have more issues. A 50-year-old home with some original systems is normal.

    Expecting an older home to have no issues is unrealistic.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cosmetic vs functional">
    Inspectors focus on function, not appearance.

    Ugly but working isn't a defect. Beautiful but failing is.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Context matters">
    A 25-year-old roof on a home priced accordingly is different from one presented as "new roof."

    Evaluate findings against price, disclosures, and expectations.
